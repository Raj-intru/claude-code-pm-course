**Your complete guide to the TaskFlow product**


## What is TaskFlow?

TaskFlow is a project management SaaS for remote teams. Think **Asana meets Linear** - beautiful like Linear, functional like Asana, but built specifically for how remote teams work.

### Core Value Proposition

**For remote teams who struggle with scattered work and unclear priorities,** TaskFlow is a project management tool **that provides context-rich task management and async collaboration.** Unlike Asana (complex, expensive) or Trello (too simple), TaskFlow **balances simplicity with power, at 50% lower cost.**


## Product Philosophy

### Key Principles

**1. Async-first design**
- No real-time coordination required
- Rich context on every task
- Updates work across timezones
- Comments replace meetings

**2. Context over status**
- Every task answers: What? Why? Who? When? How?
- No cryptic task titles
- Full background always attached
- Reduces whats this about? questions

**3. Speed matters**
- Sub-second page loads
- Keyboard shortcuts everywhere
- No loading spinners
- Instant search

**4. Opinionated with escape hatches**
- Strong defaults (workflows that work)
- Flexibility when needed
- Not overwhelming with options

**5. Beautiful and functional**
- Design quality matters
- UI guides users to success
- Delightful micro-interactions


## Core Features

### 1. Task Management

**What users can do:**
- Create tasks with rich descriptions (markdown support)

### 6. Reporting & Analytics

**What users can do:**

- Export to CSV

**Our differentiation:**

## Product Metrics

### North Star Metric

**Weekly Active Teams** - Teams that complete at least one task per week

**Why this metric?**
- Indicates real usage (not just logins)
- Measures team collaboration (not individual)
- Leading indicator of retention
- Correlates with revenue

**Current:** 850 weekly active teams
**Goal (Q1 2025):** 1,200 weekly active teams


### Product Health Metrics

**Activation:**
- **Definition:** User completes first task within 7 days of signup
- **Current:** 45%
- **Target:** 60%
- **Why it matters:** Activated users are 5x more likely to become paying customers

**Retention:**
- **Definition:** % of users active in month N who are active in month N+1
- **Current:** 65%
- **Target:** 75%
- **Why it matters:** Retention drives LTV (lifetime value)

**Time to Value:**
- **Definition:** Time from signup to first task completed
- **Current:** 45 minutes (median)
- **Target:** 15 minutes
- **Why it matters:** Faster value = higher activation

**Viral Coefficient:**
- **Definition:** Average invites sent per user Ã— invite acceptance rate
- **Current:** 1.2 (barely viral)
- **Target:** 1.5+ (truly viral)
