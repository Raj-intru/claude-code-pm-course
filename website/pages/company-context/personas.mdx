**Deep dive into who uses TaskFlow and why**


## Overview

TaskFlow serves three primary user personas across our customer base. Understanding these personas is critical for product decisions - every feature should serve at least one personas core needs.


## Persona 1: Sarah (Enterprise Admin)

### Quick Facts

**Name:** Sarah Chen
**Age:** 38
**Role:** VP of IT Operations
**Company:** TechCorp (800 employees, Series C)
**Location:** Austin, TX (remote team across US)
**TaskFlow Plan:** Enterprise

### Background

Sarah leads IT operations for a fast-growing SaaS company. Her team supports 800 employees across 15 tools. She reports to the CTO and owns IT budget ($2M annually).

**Career path:**
- Started as IT support specialist
- Grew to IT Manager
- Now VP of IT Operations (6 direct reports)
- 12 years in IT, 8 years at current company

**Education:**
- BS in Information Systems
- CISSP certified (security)

### Goals & Motivations

**Primary goals:**
1. **Reduce tool sprawl** - Currently using 25+ tools, want to consolidate to 10-12
2. **Improve security posture** - Pass SOC 2 audit, meet enterprise customer requirements
3. **Control costs** - $2M budget, need to show ROI on every tool
4. **Enable teams** - Give employees good tools without compromising security

**Success metrics:**
- Number of tools in use (down)
- Security incidents (zero)
- Employee satisfaction with tools (up)
- Tool cost per employee (down)

### Pain Points & Frustrations

**1. Tool sprawl is out of control**
- Engineering uses Linear
- Marketing uses Monday.com
- Sales uses Salesforce + Asana
- Design uses Notion
- No central place to see whats happening

**2. Security nightmares**
- Shadow IT (teams buying tools without approval)
- No visibility into who has access to what
- Former employees still have access to tools
- Cant produce audit logs when asked

**3. Onboarding/offboarding chaos**
- New hire? Need to create 25 accounts manually
- Someone leaves? Need to revoke 25 accesses
- Takes 2 days to fully provision someone

**4. No visibility**
- Cant see what teams are working on
- Cant report up to executives
- Cant forecast resource needs

### Jobs to be Done

**When...**
- ...a new employee joins → Provision all tool access in one place, automatically
- ...someone leaves → Revoke all access instantly with confidence
- ...auditors ask for logs → Provide comprehensive audit trail without scrambling
- ...evaluating new tools → Ensure they meet security standards before buying
- ...CFO asks about tool costs → Show ROI and usage metrics for every tool
- ...security incident occurs → Identify scope of access and revoke immediately

### TaskFlow Features They Care About

**Must-haves:**
- ✅ SSO (Single Sign-On) via SAML - non-negotiable
- ✅ Audit logs - who did what, when, why
- ✅ Advanced permissions - role-based access control
- ✅ Bulk user management - add/remove many users at once
- ✅ Admin dashboard - org-wide visibility

**Nice-to-haves:**
- Custom user fields (department, location, cost center)
- Usage analytics (whos using it, whos not)
- Data export (own your data)
- 99.9% uptime SLA

**Dont care about:**
- Fancy UI animations
- Social features
- Public boards
- Mobile app (desktop-first role)

### Behavior & Preferences

**How they work:**
- Deep focus: Blocks of focused work (no constant interruptions)
- Communication: Email > Slack (prefers async)
- Decision-making: Data-driven, risk-averse
- Tools: Loves dashboards, reports, analytics

**Tech savviness:** High
- Comfortable with technical concepts
- Reads security white papers
- Evaluates tools rigorously

**Buying process:**
- Does extensive research (weeks)
- Requires security review

- Pilot with 50 users before full rollout
- Typical sales cycle: 3-6 months

### Quotes

*I need one place where I can see who has access to what, and revoke it instantly if needed.*

*Security isnt negotiable. If you dont have SSO and audit logs, we cant even consider you.*

*Im tired of being the bottleneck for every tool evaluation. I need tools that just work and meet our standards.*

*When an employee leaves, I lose sleep wondering if weve revoked all their access. It shouldnt be this hard.*
