## 0.0 Introduction Reference

Welcome!!

If youre a product manager curious about Claude Code, you might be wondering: Isnt that just for developers?

**No**! Claude Code is becoming one of the most powerful productivity tools for PMs, and you dont need to write a single line of code to use it.

## What Claude Code Really Is

Think of Claude Code as your AI thought partner that lives on your computer. While traditional chatbots like ChatGPT give you helpful responses that you then copy and paste, Claude Code can actually *do things* for you – read your files, organize your documents, analyze your data, and create new materials, all through natural conversation.

Heres a simple way to understand the difference:

- **Traditional chatbots:** Great for brainstorming and getting advice, but you still have to do the work manually. Conversations disappear when you close the tab.
- **Claude Code:** Works directly with your files and folders, remembers your project context, and can execute tasks automatically. Think of it as Claude Local – an intelligent assistant that understands your entire workspace.

The name Claude Code is a bit misleading. Yes, it was originally built for software development, but an increasing number of product managers, designers, marketers, and other non-technical professionals are discovering its perfect for their work too.

## What Youll Learn in This Course

This course will guide you step-by-step to build your own PM productivity system with Claude Code.

By the end, youll be able to:

1. Create **custom agents** that help you write PRDs, generate Jira tickets, and synthesize research
2. Set up **project memory** that remembers your product, users, and writing style across all sessions
3. Build **automated workflows** for repetitive tasks like processing meeting notes and stakeholder updates
4. Maintain a **second brain** that organizes your thoughts, files, and research in one place
5. Connect **integrations** with tools you already use (Notion, Linear, Slack, GitHub)

And youll do all of this through natural conversation IN Claude Code!

Everything you learn will be immediately applicable.

## What Youll Need

**To get started, youll need:**
- A Claude Pro or Max subscription ($20/month) – the free tier doesnt include Claude Code
- A computer running Mac, Windows, or Linux
- About 15 minutes for installation

## What PMs Actually Use Claude Code For

The most successful teams treat Claude Code as a thought partner rather than just a code generator. Theyre exploring possibilities, prototyping rapidly, and sharing discoveries across technical and non-technical users. Heres what that looks like in practice:

**Strategic Work:**
- Writing PRDs by feeding Claude your research, user interviews, and competitive analysis – it synthesizes everything into a cohesive document
- Building product roadmaps by having Claude analyze market data and stakeholder input
- Processing hundreds of customer feedback responses in minutes instead of days
- Creating SWOT analyses and competitive landscapes from raw research materials

**Execution & Organization:**
- Generating user stories and Jira tickets from your feature specs
- Transforming PRDs into multiple formats: executive one-pagers, slide decks, release notes
- Organizing messy folders of research files, meeting notes, and screenshots
- Editing spreadsheets and CSV data without even opening Excel

**Communication:**
- Creating stakeholder updates in whatever format you need: email, Slack, Notion pages
- Drafting release notes from engineering changelogs (in language customers actually understand)
- Building presentation narratives from strategy documents
- Maintaining a second brain of product knowledge that persists across sessions

**Research & Analysis:**
- Running SEO audits on your marketing pages
- Analyzing competitor data and creating comparison matrices
- Synthesizing insights across user interviews, surveys, support tickets, and app reviews
- Web research and competitive intelligence gathering

## Why Claude Code Feels Different

Heres the honest comparison between what you might be used to and what Claude Code offers:

| Feature | Traditional Chatbot | Claude Code |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| **File Access** | ❌ None | ✅ Read/write any file on your computer |
| **Memory** | ❌ Disappears after session | ✅ Permanent project memory (CLAUDE.md) |
| **Execution** | ❌ Suggests, but you do it | ✅ Actually executes commands and creates files |
| **Multi-file** | ❌ One-off responses | ✅ Works across dozens of documents simultaneously |
| **Agents** | ❌ Single instance | ✅ Clone yourself – run 5 agents in parallel |
| **Integrations** | ❌ Limited | ✅ Connect to Notion, Linear, Slack, GitHub via MCPs |
| **Version Control** | ❌ No history | ✅ Git integration, checkpoints, rewind |
| **Automation** | ❌ Manual copy-paste | ✅ True automation with custom commands |

The key difference? Persistence and execution. Claude Code doesnt just give you advice – it actually does the work with you.

## A Real Example

Heres a story that illustrates the potential: A product manager at Monday.com built a workflow where Claude Code helped him gather and analyze 34,000 Reddit comments about his product. Claude identified patterns, pain points, and priority themes that directly informed the product roadmap.

His estimate? This would have taken weeks manually – if it was even possible. With Claude Code: a few hours.

This isnt about replacing your judgment or expertise. Its about having an intelligent assistant that can handle the heavy lifting while you focus on the strategic thinking and decision-making that only you can do.


## The Mindset Shift

Peter Steinberger, a developer who built PDF Expert, observed something interesting about Claude Code:

> Claude Code represents developers becoming orchestrators of incredibly powerful systems rather than command typists.

The same transformation is happening for product managers. Youre not learning to code – youre learning to orchestrate. You think about what needs to happen, and Claude Code figures out how to make it happen.

**The honest truth about the learning curve:**

Yes, Claude Code runs in the terminal, which might feel unfamiliar at first. But heres the thing: you wont need to learn terminal commands. Youll be having conversations. Well guide you through every step, and by the end of the first module, the terminal wont feel intimidating anymore – itll just feel like where you talk to Claude.

The mindset shift is actually the bigger adjustment: moving from I need to learn this command to I need this outcome. Once that clicks, everything else flows naturally.

**Time investment:**
- Level 1 (Foundation): 2-3 hours to learn the basics
- Level 2 (Practitioner): 4-5 hours to master daily PM workflows
- Level 3 (Master): 3-4 hours to build advanced automation

Total: About 10-12 hours to go from complete beginner to confident power user. After that, youll likely save 5-10 hours every week on tasks that used to be time-consuming.

## Ready to Start?

In the next module, youll install Claude Code and get everything set up. Its straightforward, and well walk you through each step.

**Module 0.1:** Installation & Prerequisites
