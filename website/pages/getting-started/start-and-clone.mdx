## 0.2: Start & Clone

 - **Time to Complete:** 5 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Claude Code installed (Module 0.1)

## üìñ Overview

Module 0.2 demonstrates the core principle of Claude Code: describe what you want, Claude handles the implementation. Instead of manually running git commands, you'll tell Claude to clone the repository and it will handle all the technical details.

**Key takeaway:** Claude Code transforms natural language requests into precise terminal operations. This pattern works for any repository - internal docs, open-source projects, or personal code.


## üì¶ Download and Start

Copy and paste this command into your terminal to download the course and launch Claude Code:

```bash
cd ~/Documents && \
curl -L https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course/releases/latest/download/complete-course.zip -o course.zip && \
unzip course.zip -d claude-code-course && \
cd claude-code-course && \
claude
```

**What this does:**
1. Navigates to your Documents folder
2. Downloads the course materials
3. Extracts them to `claude-code-course`
4. Navigates into the course folder
5. Launches Claude Code with full course context

**Expected output:**

```bash
  % Total    % Received
Archive:  course.zip
  inflating: claude-code-course/README.md
  inflating: claude-code-course/.claude/commands/start-1-1.md
  ...

# Claude Code launches inside the course folder
```

Once Claude Code starts, you'll have full access to all course files and can run the interactive `/start` commands.


## üéØ Alternative: Let Claude Do It

Want to see Claude Code in action before starting the course? You can ask Claude to handle the download for you:

1. Open your terminal and run `claude`
2. Tell Claude: "Download the course materials from https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course/releases/latest/download/complete-course.zip and extract it to a folder called claude-code-course in my Documents folder"
3. Exit and navigate: `exit`, then `cd ~/Documents/claude-code-course && claude`

This demonstrates Claude Code's core principle: describe what you want in natural language, and Claude handles the implementation.


## ‚ùì Common Questions

### What if curl or unzip aren't installed?

Most Mac and Linux systems have these built-in. If you get an error:
- **Mac:** Install Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
- **Windows:** Use Git Bash or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **Linux:** Install via your package manager: `sudo apt install curl unzip` (Ubuntu/Debian)

### Can I change the download location?

Yes! Change `~/Documents` in the command to any folder:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop && curl -L https://... && unzip ... && cd claude-code-course && claude
```

### Can I download other materials this way?

Absolutely. This pattern works for any downloadable files:
- GitHub release assets
- Direct download links
- Company documentation
- Any zip file URL

Just replace the URL and folder names as needed.

### What if the download fails?

Try downloading the zip manually from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course/releases/latest), then:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
unzip complete-course.zip -d ~/Documents/claude-code-course
cd ~/Documents/claude-code-course
claude
```


## üß™ Testing Your Setup

Verify Claude has course context with these prompts:

```
Show me all the Level 1 modules.
```

```
List the learning objectives for Module 1.3
```

```
What user personas are available in the context folder?
```

**Observe how Claude:**
- Interprets your request
- Finds relevant files
- Reads and analyzes content
- Provides clear answers

This is your new workflow.


## üí° Best Practices

**Natural Language First:**
- Describe your goal, not the commands
- Let Claude figure out the implementation details
- Example: "Download and extract the course to my Documents" not "cd ~/Documents && curl..."

**Verify Context:**
- Always open Claude Code from your course materials folder
- Use `/start` commands only when inside the `claude-code-course` folder
- Claude's effectiveness depends on having proper file context

**Learn by Doing:**
- The interactive modules teach through hands-on practice
- This reference guide provides quick lookups and deeper context
- Combine both for the best learning experience


## üöÄ What's Next?

You've cloned the course and verified Claude Code has proper context. Now you're ready for the interactive learning experience.

**Module 1.1:** Start with TaskFlow, the sample SaaS product you'll use throughout this course.

Interactive track: Type `/start-1-1`
