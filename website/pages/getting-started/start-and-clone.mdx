## 0.2 Start & Clone Reference

**Goal:** Have your first real interaction with Claude Code and let it set up your learning environment.

**The Big Insight:** Youre about to learn by doing. Instead of manually cloning a repository or setting up folders, youll simply tell Claude what you want – and watch it happen.

**Time:** 5 minutes

Lets go.


## Step 1: Start Claude Code

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
claude
```

Press Enter.

**What youll see:**

```
Welcome to Claude Code

Lets get started.

```

Youre now inside Claude Code. Think of this as your AI-powered command center.

## Step 2: Clone the Course Repository

Heres where it gets interesting. Youre going to ask Claude to clone this entire course repository and set it up for you.

**Type this (or something like it in your own words):**

```
Clone the Claude Code PM course repository from
https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course and set it up for me. 
Put it in a folder called claude-code-pm-course in my Documents folder.
```

Press Enter.


## Step 3: Watch Claude Work

Brace yourself for the first aha! moment of many:

**Claude will:**
1. Understand your intent
2. Figure out where your Documents folder is
3. Navigate to that directory
4. Run the `git clone` command with the correct URL
5. Name the folder appropriately
6. Confirm success
7. Navigate into the new directory

**Youll see output like:**

```
Ill help you clone the repository and set it up.

Tool Use: bash
Command: cd ~/Documents && git clone https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course claude-code-pm-course

Resolving deltas: 100% (78/78), done.

Tool Use: bash
Command: cd ~/Documents/claude-code-pm-course

✓ Successfully cloned the repository to ~/Documents/claude-code-pm-course
✓ Navigated into the course directory

Youre all set! The course is now available at:
/Users/[your-username]/Documents/claude-code-pm-course

Would you like me to show you the directory structure?
```

**This is the new way of working.**


## Step 4: Exit Claude Code & Open Your Course Folder

Now that the repository is cloned, you'll need to exit to launch Claude specifically in this course.

**There are two ways to do it:**

### Option One: Find it in the File Explorer

Navigate to your Documents folder and find the `claude-code-pm-course` folder. Then right-click and select "New Terminal at Folder"

It will look something like this:

![Opening folder from file explorer](/images/folder-location.png)

Then type `claude` and hit Enter

### Option Two: Open it from the Terminal

**Exit Claude Code:**
```
Type: exit
```

You should be back at your regular terminal prompt.

Type these commands:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/claude-code-pm-course
claude
```

This navigates to your course folder and opens Claude Code directly inside it.

**Either way, you end up at the same place:**
Claude Code is now open with full context of all the course files – ready for the interactive learning experience.

**Success!** Youve just cloned an entire course repository without typing a single git command. Now you have Claude Code open with the full course context ready to go.

## Common Questions

### Do I need to understand git?

**No.** Thats the point. You stated what you wanted, Claude handled the implementation.

### What if I dont have git installed?

Claude will detect this and help you install it. Just follow the prompts.

### Can I do this with other repositories?

**Absolutely.** This same pattern works for any git repository:
- Clone your companys internal docs
- Clone open-source projects
- Clone your own projects from GitHub

Just tell Claude what you want.

### What if something goes wrong?

Claude will tell you what went wrong and suggest fixes. You can ask:
- What went wrong?
- How do I fix this?
- Try again with a different approach


## Try It Yourself: Navigate the Course

Now that the course is cloned, practice giving Claude instructions:

**Try these prompts:**

```
Show me all the Level 1 modules.
```

```
Open the README file and summarize what this course teaches.
```

```
What are the learning objectives for Module 1.3?
```

```
List all the TaskFlow user personas available in the context folder.
```

**Observe how Claude:**
- Interprets your request
- Finds the right files
- Reads them
- Gives you a clear answer

**This is your new workflow.**

You're ready to begin! Go to [Module 1.1: Welcome to TaskFlow](/fundamentals/welcome)
