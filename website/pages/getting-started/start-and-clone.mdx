## 0.2: Start & Clone

 - **Time to Complete:** 5 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Claude Code installed (Module 0.1)

## üìñ Overview

Module 0.2 demonstrates the core principle of Claude Code: describe what you want, Claude handles the implementation. Instead of manually running git commands, you'll tell Claude to clone the repository and it will handle all the technical details.

**Key takeaway:** Claude Code transforms natural language requests into precise terminal operations. This pattern works for any repository - internal docs, open-source projects, or personal code.


## How to Open Your Terminal

All the commands below need to be typed into your **terminal**. Here's how to open it:

**Mac:**
1. Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight
2. Type "Terminal"
3. Press Enter

**Windows:**
1. Press the Windows key
2. Type "PowerShell"
3. Press Enter


## üì¶ Download and Start

**Open your terminal, then click the copy button <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth="2" height="16" width="16" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'text-bottom', marginLeft: '2px', marginRight: '2px'}}><rect x="9" y="9" width="13" height="13" rx="2"></rect><path d="M5 15H4C2.89543 15 2 14.1046 2 13V4C2 2.89543 2.89543 2 4 2H13C14.1046 2 15 2.89543 15 4V5"></path></svg> in the top-right corner of the code block below, paste the command into your terminal, and press Enter:**

```bash
cd ~/Documents && \
curl -L https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course/releases/latest/download/complete-course.zip -o course.zip && \
unzip course.zip -d claude-code-course && \
cd claude-code-course && \
claude
```

**What this does:**
1. Navigates to your Documents folder
2. Downloads the course materials
3. Extracts them to `claude-code-course`
4. Navigates into the course folder
5. Launches Claude Code with full course context

**Expected output:**

```bash
  % Total    % Received
Archive:  course.zip
  inflating: claude-code-course/README.md
  inflating: claude-code-course/.claude/commands/start-1-1.md
  ...

# Claude Code launches inside the course folder
```

Once Claude Code starts, you'll have full access to all course files and can run the interactive `/start` commands.


## üéØ Alternative: Let Claude Do It

Want to see Claude Code in action before starting the course? You can ask Claude to handle the download for you:

1. **In your terminal, type:** `claude` (then press Enter)
2. **Tell Claude:** "Download the course materials from https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course/releases/latest/download/complete-course.zip and extract it to a folder called claude-code-course in my Documents folder"
3. **Exit and navigate - type these commands in your terminal:** `exit`, then `cd ~/Documents/claude-code-course && claude`

This demonstrates Claude Code's core principle: describe what you want in natural language, and Claude handles the implementation.


## ‚ùì Common Questions

### What if curl or unzip aren't installed?

Most Mac systems have these built-in. If you get an error:
- **Mac:** Type this in your terminal: `xcode-select --install`
- **Windows:** Curl and unzip aren't built-in. Download the zip manually from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course/releases/latest), extract it to your Documents folder, then open your terminal and type: `cd ~/Documents/claude-code-course && claude`

### Can I change the download location?

Yes! Change `~/Documents` in the command to any folder. For example, to download to your Desktop:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop && curl -L https://... && unzip ... && cd claude-code-course && claude
```

### Can I download other materials this way?

Absolutely. This pattern works for any downloadable files:
- GitHub release assets
- Direct download links
- Company documentation
- Any zip file URL

Just replace the URL and folder names as needed.

### What if the download fails?

Try downloading the zip manually from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course/releases/latest), then **type these commands in your terminal:**
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
unzip complete-course.zip -d ~/Documents/claude-code-course
cd ~/Documents/claude-code-course
claude
```


## üß™ Testing Your Setup

Verify Claude has course context. **Once Claude Code is running, type these prompts to Claude** (these are NOT terminal commands - you're having a conversation with Claude):

**Say to Claude:**
```
Show me all the Level 1 modules.
```

**Say to Claude:**
```
List the learning objectives for Module 1.3
```

**Say to Claude:**
```
What user personas are available in the context folder?
```

**Observe how Claude:**
- Interprets your request
- Finds relevant files
- Reads and analyzes content
- Provides clear answers

This is your new workflow.


## üí° Best Practices

**Natural Language First:**
- Describe your goal, not the commands
- Let Claude figure out the implementation details
- Example: "Download and extract the course to my Documents" not "cd ~/Documents && curl..."

**Verify Context:**
- Always open Claude Code from your course materials folder
- Use `/start` commands only when inside the `claude-code-course` folder
- Claude's effectiveness depends on having proper file context

**Learn by Doing:**
- The interactive modules teach through hands-on practice
- This reference guide provides quick lookups and deeper context
- Combine both for the best learning experience


## üöÄ What's Next?

You've cloned the course and verified Claude Code has proper context. Now you're ready for the interactive learning experience.

**Module 1.1:** Start with TaskFlow, the sample SaaS product you'll use throughout this course.

Interactive track: **Inside Claude Code, type:** `/start-1-1`
