## 0.2: Start & Clone

 - **Time to Complete:** 5 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Claude Code installed (Module 0.1)

## üìñ Overview

Module 0.2 demonstrates the core principle of Claude Code: describe what you want, Claude handles the implementation. Instead of manually running git commands, you'll tell Claude to clone the repository and it will handle all the technical details.

**Key takeaway:** Claude Code transforms natural language requests into precise terminal operations. This pattern works for any repository - internal docs, open-source projects, or personal code.


## üöÄ Starting Claude Code

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
claude
```

You'll see the Claude Code interface appear. This is your AI-powered command center with full access to your file system and terminal.


## üì¶ Cloning the Course Repository

Tell Claude what you want in natural language:

```
Clone the Claude Code PM course repository from
https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course and set it up for me.
Put it in a folder called claude-code-pm-course in my Documents folder.
```

**What Claude will do:**
1. Navigate to your Documents folder
2. Run `git clone` with the correct URL
3. Name the folder appropriately
4. Navigate into the new directory
5. Confirm success

**Example output:**

```
Tool Use: bash
Command: cd ~/Documents && git clone https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course

Cloning into claude-code-pm-course...
remote: Enumerating objects: 234, done.
Receiving objects: 100% (234/234), done.

‚úì Successfully cloned the repository to ~/Documents/claude-code-pm-course
‚úì Navigated into the course directory
```

**This is the new way of working:** State your intent, Claude handles implementation.


## üìÇ Opening the Course Folder

Exit Claude Code and reopen it inside the course folder to access all course files and interactive modules.

### Option 1: From File Explorer

1. Navigate to `Documents/claude-code-pm-course`
2. Right-click folder ‚Üí "New Terminal at Folder"
3. Run `claude`

### Option 2: From Terminal

```bash
# Exit Claude Code
exit

# Navigate and restart
cd ~/Documents/claude-code-pm-course
claude
```

**Result:** Claude Code now has full context of all course files and can run the interactive `/start` commands.


## ‚ùì Common Questions

### Do I need to understand git?

No. The pattern is: describe what you want, Claude handles the technical implementation. This applies to git, file operations, and most terminal tasks.

### What if git isn't installed?

Claude will detect this and guide you through installation. Follow the prompts.

### Can I clone other repositories this way?

Yes. This pattern works for any git repository:
- Company internal documentation
- Open-source projects
- Personal GitHub repositories

Just tell Claude the URL and where you want it.

### What if something goes wrong?

Claude will diagnose the error and suggest fixes. Ask:
- "What went wrong?"
- "How do I fix this?"
- "Try again with a different approach"


## üß™ Testing Your Setup

Verify Claude has course context with these prompts:

```
Show me all the Level 1 modules.
```

```
List the learning objectives for Module 1.3
```

```
What user personas are available in the context folder?
```

**Observe how Claude:**
- Interprets your request
- Finds relevant files
- Reads and analyzes content
- Provides clear answers

This is your new workflow.


## üí° Best Practices

**Natural Language First:**
- Describe your goal, not the commands
- Let Claude figure out the implementation details
- Example: "Clone this repo to my Documents" not "cd ~/Documents && git clone..."

**Verify Context:**
- Always open Claude Code from your project root
- Use `/start` commands only when inside the course folder
- Claude's effectiveness depends on having proper file context

**Learn by Doing:**
- The interactive modules teach through hands-on practice
- This reference guide provides quick lookups and deeper context
- Combine both for the best learning experience


## üöÄ What's Next?

You've cloned the course and verified Claude Code has proper context. Now you're ready for the interactive learning experience.

**Module 1.1:** Start with TaskFlow, the sample SaaS product you'll use throughout this course.

Interactive track: Type `/start-1-1`
