## 1.2: Visualizing Files with Obsidian

 - **Time to Complete:** 15-20 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Module 1.1 complete, basic familiarity with file systems


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-2` to kick off the interactive experience.

## üìñ Overview

Set up Obsidian to visualize your project files in real-time alongside Claude Code for a seamless split-screen workflow.

**Key takeaway:** Visual workspace lets you watch files appear and update as Claude works.


## üéØ Why Visualization Matters

Working with Claude Code in a terminal feels like working blind. You ask Claude to create documents, but you can't see what's happening.

**The solution:** Open Obsidian alongside your terminal. Now you can:
- Watch files appear as Claude creates them
- Read documents while Claude is working
- Verify everything is organized correctly
- Always know exactly what's happening

This transforms Claude Code from a mysterious black box into a transparent tool you can watch and verify in real-time.


## üé® Why Obsidian?

Obsidian is perfect for PMs because it's built for markdown (PRDs, notes, docs) and has a clean, distraction-free interface. It's free, fast, and works offline.

**Alternatives:** VS Code (more powerful) or Cursor (VS Code + AI) also work great. We'll use Obsidian for this course since it's ideal for PM work.


## üöÄ Setup Guide

**Download:** Visit https://obsidian.md/download (free for personal use)

**Open your project:** In Obsidian, select "Open folder as vault" and navigate to your course folder (ask Claude for the path if needed)

**Split-screen workflow:** Position Claude Code terminal and Obsidian side-by-side to watch files appear in real-time


## ‚ö†Ô∏è The .claude/ Folder

**Key limitation:** Obsidian cannot display hidden folders (folders starting with `.`)

The `.claude/` folder contains agents, commands, and settings. You won't see it in Obsidian - this is normal.

**To view `.claude/` files:**
- **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Shift + .` in Finder to show hidden folders
- **Windows:** Enable "Hidden items" in File Explorer View tab

**When you need it:** Module 1.5 (Custom Sub-Agents) and later. For now, focus on regular project files.

**Note:** Claude Code can access `.claude/` files - only Obsidian can't display them.


## üé¨ Real-Time Visualization Demo

When Claude creates or edits files, you'll watch them appear in Obsidian instantly.

**Try it:**

1. Open Obsidian with your project folder
2. In Claude Code, ask: *Create a file called test-visualization.md with some content*
3. Watch Obsidian - the file appears immediately
4. Click it to read what Claude wrote

That's it! No refresh needed. Files update in real-time as Claude works.


## üí° Obsidian Tips for PM Work

**Essential shortcuts:**
- **`Cmd/Ctrl + O`** - Quick Switcher (jump to any file)
- **`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F`** - Search across all files
- **`Cmd/Ctrl + E`** - Toggle Reading/Editing view

**Wikilinks:** Connect documents with `[[filename]]` syntax for easy navigation

**Tags:** Organize with `#prd #user-research #q1-2025` for filtering

**Stay in Reading view** for cleaner formatted display


## üíº Example: Real-Time Workflow

**Without visualization:** Claude creates files, but you're unsure what happened or where they are.

**With Obsidian:** Watch files appear instantly, click to review content, verify organization - complete visibility and control.


## ‚úÖ Best Practices

**Do:**
- Use split-screen workflow constantly
- Leverage `Cmd/Ctrl+O` Quick Switcher
- Stay in Reading view for cleaner display

**Don't:**
- Expect to see `.claude/` folder (it's hidden - use Finder/Explorer)
- Work full-screen terminal only (you're missing half the value)


## üêõ Troubleshooting

**I don't see any files:**

**Likely cause:** Wrong folder opened as vault

**Fix:**
1. Ask Claude: Whats the path to my course folder?
2. In Obsidian: Settings ‚Üí About ‚Üí Close vault
3. Open folder as vault again, using the exact path Claude gave you
4. Your files should now appear

**Common mistake:** Opening a parent folder instead of the project folder itself

**Example:**
- ‚ùå Opened: `/Users/yourname/Documents` (too high level)
- ‚úÖ Should open: `/Users/yourname/Documents/claude-code-pm-course`

### Files arent updating in Obsidian

**Likely cause:** Obsidian needs to detect the change

**Fix:**
1. Click outside and back into Obsidian window (forces refresh)
2. Or: Close and reopen the specific file
3. Or: Restart Obsidian (rare, but works)

**Prevention:** Usually this doesnt happen. If it does repeatedly, check:
- Is Obsidian set to the right folder?
- Are you editing the right file? (check file paths)

### I see weird code/formatting in files

**Likely cause:** Youre in Editing view instead of Reading view

**What youre seeing:**
```markdown
# This is a heading

**This is bold** and *this is italic*

- Bullet point
- Another bullet
```

**What you should see:** Formatted text (actual heading, actual bold, actual bullets)

**Fix:**
- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + E` to toggle to Reading view
- Or click the book icon (top-right of file view)

### Wheres the .claude/ folder? I cant find it!

**Answer:** Its hidden! This is normal and expected.

**To see it:**

**Mac:**
1. Open Finder
2. Navigate to your project folder
3. Press: `Cmd + Shift + .` (period)
4. `.claude/` becomes visible (dimmed/gray)

**Windows:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to your project folder
3. View tab ‚Üí Check Hidden items
4. `.claude/`
