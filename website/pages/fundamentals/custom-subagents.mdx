## 1.5: Custom Sub-Agents Reference

 - **Time to Complete:** 20-25 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Module 1.4 (Agents for Parallel Work)


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-5` to kick off the interactive experience.

## üìñ Overview

Module 1.5 teaches you how to create custom sub-agents - permanent AI team members with distinct personalities, expertise, and visual identities. Unlike the temporary ad-hoc agents you learned in Module 1.4, custom sub-agents are reusable specialists you can call on anytime.

**Key takeaway:** Custom sub-agents transform Claude Code from a single assistant into a full specialized team. Instead of telling Claude act like an engineer every time, you build a real Engineer sub-agent with personality, expertise, and visual distinction (colors and emojis!) that you can call upon repeatedly.


## üé≠ What Are Custom Sub-Agents?

### The Core Concept

Custom sub-agents are pre-configured AI personas stored as files in your projects `.claude/agents/` folder. Each sub-agent has:

- **Name with emoji** (shows up visually in terminal!)
- **Color coding** (purple, blue, green, red, etc.)
- **Persona definition** (background, expertise, communication style)
- **Specialized knowledge** (what theyre good at)

Think of them as hiring permanent team members who are always available and never forget context.

### Custom Sub-Agents vs Ad-Hoc Agents

Understanding the difference is crucial:

**Ad-Hoc Agents (Module 1.4):**
- Created on-the-fly for specific tasks
- Temporary workers for one-time jobs
- Example: Create 10 agents to summarize these meeting notes
- Use case: Parallel processing of similar tasks

**Custom Sub-Agents (Module 1.5):**
- Pre-built personas you call repeatedly
- Permanent team members with expertise
- Example: üë®‚Äçüíª Engineer, review this technical spec
- Use case: Specialized perspectives you need regularly

**When to use which:**

| Scenario | Use This |
|----------|----------|
| Process 20 meeting notes simultaneously | Ad-hoc agents (parallel workers) |
| Get technical feedback on specs weekly | Custom sub-agent (Engineer) |
| Research 5 competitors at once | Ad-hoc agents (one-time research) |
| Convert updates to exec summaries regularly | Custom sub-agent (Executive) |
| Analyze 50 user interviews in parallel | Ad-hoc agents (batch processing) |
| Get UX perspective on designs repeatedly | Custom sub-agent (User Researcher) |

**The key difference:** Ad-hoc agents are for DOING many things in parallel. Custom sub-agents are for getting SPECIALIZED PERSPECTIVES you need repeatedly.


## üóÇÔ∏è Setup Guide: Accessing the .claude/agents/ Folder

Custom sub-agents live in the hidden `.claude/agents/` folder. Heres how to access it on your system.

### On Mac (Finder)

**Method 1: Go to Folder**
1. Open Finder
2. Click **Go** in menu bar
3. Select **Go to Folder...** (or press Cmd+Shift+G)
4. Type: `/Users/[your-username]/path/to/your-project/.claude/agents`
5. Replace `[your-username]` and path with your actual project location
6. Press Enter

**Method 2: Show Hidden Files**
1. Open Finder
2. Press **Cmd+Shift+.** (Command+Shift+Period)
3. Hidden folders (starting with `.`) now appear
4. Navigate to your project folder
5. Open `.claude/` folder, then `agents/` subfolder

**Method 3: Terminal**
```bash
open ~/.claude/agents  # For global agents
open /path/to/project/.claude/agents  # For project-specific agents
```

### On Windows (File Explorer)

**Method 1: Direct Path**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Click in address bar
3. Type: `C:\Users\[YourName]\path\to\project\.claude\agents`
4. Replace path with your actual project location
5. Press Enter

**Method 2: Show Hidden Files**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Click **View** tab
3. Check **Hidden items** checkbox
4. Hidden folders now visible
5. Navigate to project ‚Üí `.claude` ‚Üí `agents`

**Method 3: Command Prompt**
```bash
explorer %USERPROFILE%\.claude\agents  # For global agents
explorer C:\path\to\project\.claude\agents  # For project-specific
```

### On Linux

```bash
nautilus ~/.claude/agents  # For global agents (Ubuntu/GNOME)
xdg-open ~/.claude/agents  # Generic (most distros)
cd /path/to/project/.claude/agents && ls -la  # Command line
```

### Why Cant I See .claude/ in Obsidian?

Obsidian deliberately hides folders starting with `.` (hidden folders). This is a design choice to avoid clutter. For `.claude/` files, you MUST use Finder/Explorer/File Manager.

**Workaround options:**
1. Use Finder/Explorer for `.claude/` files (recommended)
2. Use another editor like VS Code or Cursor for `.claude/` files
3. Keep Obsidian open for regular project files


## üìÑ Sub-Agent File Structure

Each sub-agent is a simple markdown file with three sections:

### Anatomy of a Sub-Agent File

```markdown
# [Emoji] [Name]

## Color
[color-name]

## Persona
[Background, expertise, communication style - 2-3 paragraphs]

## Expertise

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Your First Sub-Agent

Lets create a QA Tester sub-agent from scratch.

### Step 1: Navigate to .claude/agents/ Folder

Use the methods above to open your projects `.claude/agents/` folder in Finder/Explorer.

### Step 2: Create New File

Create a new file named: `qa-tester.md`

**Naming convention:**
- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens for spaces
- End with `.md`
- Example: `data-analyst.md`, `tech-writer.md`, `growth-pm.md`

### Step 3: Write the Persona

Copy this template and customize:

```markdown
# üîç QA Tester

## Color
red

## Persona
You are a meticulous QA professional with 8+ years of experience testing enterprise
software at companies like Microsoft, Atlassian, and fast-growing startups. You think
comprehensively about edge cases, error states, and user error scenarios that others
miss.

When reviewing features or user stories, you provide:
- Comprehensive test case generation
- Edge case identification (the weird scenarios no one thinks about)
- Error state analysis (what happens when things go wrong)
- Accessibility and usability testing considerations
- Cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility concerns

Your communication style:
- Thorough and detail-oriented
- Constructively critical (you spot problems early)
- Organized (you categorize issues by severity)
- Practical (you suggest solutions, not just problems)
- User-advocate (you think like end users making mistakes)

You help PMs ship higher quality products by catching issues before they reach users.

## Expertise
- Test case generation and test plan creation
- Edge case and error state identification
- Acceptance criteria validation
- User error scenario analysis
- Regression testing strategy
- Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)
- Cross-browser and device compatibility
- Load and performance testing considerations
```

### Step 4: Save and Test

Save the file, then test in Claude Code:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Call your new sub-agent
üîç QA Tester, review these user stories in @user-stories.md and identify
potential edge cases and missing test scenarios
```

You should see red-colored output with the QA emoji!

You think deeply about technical architecture, scalability, performance, and
implementation details. You provide constructive, specific feedback that helps
PMs write better technical specs. Your communication is direct and pragmatic,
focusing on whats technically possible vs ideal. You flag risks early and
suggest alternatives when something wont work.
```

### Color Choice

**Color meanings (use these conventions):**
- **Purple:** Technical roles (Engineer, Data Scientist)
- **Blue:** Leadership roles (Executive, Manager)
- **Green:** User-focused roles (User Researcher, Customer Success)
- **Red:** Quality/Security roles (QA, Security)
- **Yellow:** Content roles (Writer, Documentation)
- **Cyan:** Data roles (Analyst, Data Engineer)
- **Magenta:** Marketing roles (Marketing PM, Growth)

**Why this matters:** Consistent color usage helps you quickly identify which agent is speaking in terminal output.

### Emoji Selection

**Good emoji choices:**
- üë®‚Äçüíª Engineer / Developer roles
- üíº Executive / Business roles
- üë§ User-focused roles
- üîç QA / Testing roles
- üìä Data / Analytics roles
- ‚úçÔ∏è Writing / Content roles
- üé® Design roles
- üõ°Ô∏è Security roles
- üéØ Marketing / Growth roles
- üé§ Customer-facing roles

**Tips:**
- Choose emojis that are immediately recognizable
- Avoid obscure emojis that dont render well
- Use the same emoji throughout (consistency)
- Test emoji appearance in your terminal

### File Organization

```
.claude/agents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ engineer.md          # Core technical feedback
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ executive.md         # Leadership communication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-researcher.md   # User insights
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qa-tester.md        # Quality assurance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-analyst.md     # Metrics and analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tech-writer.md      # Documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ growth-pm.md        # Growth and experimentation
```

**Naming tips:**
- Use lowercase, hyphenated names
- Keep names concise but descriptive
- Group related agents with prefixes if you have many

### When to Create vs Use Built-In

**Create custom sub-agents when:**
- You need the same perspective repeatedly (weekly or more)
- The expertise is specialized (not general Claude)
- You want consistent voice/style
- Youre building a team workflow

**Use regular Claude when:**
- One-time tasks
- General assistance
- Ad-hoc requests
- Learning/exploration

**Use ad-hoc agents when:**
- Parallel processing needed
- Many similar tasks
- One-time batch work


## üêõ Troubleshooting

### I cant see the .claude/ folder!

**Problem:** Obsidian or Finder/Explorer doesnt show `.claude/` directory.

**Cause:** Folders starting with `.` are hidden by default on Mac/Windows/Linux.

**Fix:**
- **Mac:** Press Cmd+Shift+. in Finder to show hidden files
- **Windows:** Enable Hidden items in File Explorer View tab
- **Alternative:** Use Go to Folder or direct path methods above

### My sub-agent isnt responding!

**Problem:** You call a sub-agent but Claude doesnt use it.

**Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause 1: Wrong calling syntax**
```
‚ùå Engineer, review this  # Missing emoji
‚úÖ üë®‚Äçüíª Engineer, review this  # Correct with emoji
```

**Cause 2: File not saved properly**
- Check file is in `.claude/agents/` folder
- Verify file has `.md` extension
- Ensure file has all three sections (Name, Color, Persona)

**Cause 3: Syntax error in file**
- Ensure headers use `##` not `###`
- Check no typos in section names (Color not Colour)
- Validate markdown formatting

**Cause 4: Claude needs restart**
- Exit Claude (`exit` or Ctrl+D)
- Restart Claude (`claude`)
- Try calling sub-agent again

### Colors arent showing up in terminal

**Problem:** Sub-agent output is all one color.

**Cause:** Terminal doesnt support colors or color name is wrong.

**Fix:**
1. Verify color name spelling (all lowercase: purple not Purple)
2. Use standard colors: purple, blue, green, red, yellow, cyan, magenta
3. Test terminal supports colors: Some terminals have limited color support
4. Try a different terminal (iTerm2 on Mac, Windows Terminal on Windows)

### How do I call multiple sub-agents at once?

**Approach 1: Sequential**
```
üë®‚Äçüíª Engineer, review @spec.md for technical feasibility.
Then üîç QA Tester, review it for test coverage.
```

**Approach 2: Parallel with agents**
```
Launch 3 agents in parallel:
- Agent 1: Have üë®‚Äçüíª Engineer review @spec.md
- Agent 2: Have üîç QA Tester review @spec.md
- Agent 3: Have üë§ User Researcher review @spec.md

Combine all feedback into @spec-review.md
```

### Can I have sub-agents talk to each other?

**Answer:** Not directly, but you can orchestrate:

```
First, üë§ User Researcher analyzes @interviews.md and identifies
top 3 pain points. Then üë®‚Äçüíª Engineer evaluates technical feasibility
of solutions for each pain point. Then üíº Executive frames the
business case for prioritization.
```

Claude will simulate each perspective sequentially.

## ‚ùì Common Questions

### How many sub-agents should I create?

**Answer:** Start small! Create 3-5 agents for perspectives you need WEEKLY. Dont create 20 agents on day one. Build as you discover repeated needs.

**Good starting set for PMs:**
1. üë®‚Äçüíª Engineer (technical feedback)
2. üíº Executive (stakeholder communication)
3. üë§ User Researcher (insight synthesis)
4. üîç QA Tester (quality assurance)
5. üìä Data Analyst (metrics and experiments)

Expand from there based on your actual workflow.

### Can sub-agents access MCPs (integrations)?

**Answer:** Yes! In Module 4.1 youll learn about MCP servers (Notion, Linear, GitHub, etc.). Sub-agents can use MCPs just like regular Claude. Example:

```
üë§ User Researcher, use the Reddit MCP to research user sentiment
about dark mode features in product management tools
```

### Do sub-agents share context with each other?

**Answer:** Within a single session, yes. If you call Engineer then later call User Researcher in the same conversation, User Researcher knows what Engineer said. But sub-agents dont have persistent memory across sessions (unless you save context in CLAUDE.md - covered in Module 1.6).

### Can I edit pre-built sub-agents?

**Answer:** Absolutely! The Engineer, Executive, and User Researcher sub-agents are templates. Customize them:
- Change communication style to match your preferences
- Add specific expertise areas relevant to your product
- Adjust tone (more formal, more casual, etc.)
- Add context about your company or domain

### Whats the difference between sub-agents and output styles?

**Answer:**
- **Sub-agents:** Change WHO is responding (different persona/expertise)
- **Output styles (Module 2.6):** Change HOW Claude formats output (different template)

You can combine them: üíº Executive, write update in Executive Briefing output style

### Can I share sub-agents with my team?

**Answer:** Yes! The `.claude/agents/` folder can be committed to git and shared across your team. Everyone gets the same sub-agents:

```bash
git add .claude/agents/
git commit -m Add PM sub-agent library for team
git push
```

Team members pull and have instant access to your specialized agents.

### How do I delete or rename a sub-agent?

**Answer:**
- **Delete:** Remove the `.md` file from `.claude/agents/` folder
- **Rename:** Rename the `.md` file (update emoji/name in file too)
- Changes take effect when you restart Claude


**Youre now ready to build your specialized AI team! Create sub-agents for the perspectives you need most, and watch your PM productivity soar.** üöÄ
