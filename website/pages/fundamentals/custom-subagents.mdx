## 1.5: Custom Sub-Agents

 - **Time to Complete:** 20-25 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Module 1.4 (Agents for Parallel Work)


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-5` to kick off the interactive experience.

## 📖 Overview

Module 1.5 teaches you how to create custom sub-agents - permanent AI team members with distinct personalities, expertise, and visual identities. Unlike the temporary ad-hoc agents you learned in Module 1.4, custom sub-agents are reusable specialists you can call on anytime.

**Key takeaway:** Custom sub-agents transform Claude Code from a single assistant into a full specialized team. Instead of telling Claude act like an engineer every time, you build a real Engineer sub-agent with personality, expertise, and visual distinction (colors and emojis!) that you can call upon repeatedly.


## 🎭 What Are Custom Sub-Agents?

### The Core Concept

Custom sub-agents are pre-configured AI personas stored as files in your projects `.claude/agents/` folder. Each sub-agent has:

- **Name with emoji** (shows up visually in terminal!)
- **Color coding** (purple, blue, green, red, etc.)
- **Persona definition** (background, expertise, communication style)
- **Specialized knowledge** (what theyre good at)

Think of them as hiring permanent team members who are always available and never forget context.

### Custom Sub-Agents vs Ad-Hoc Agents

Understanding the difference is crucial:

**Ad-Hoc Agents (Module 1.4):**
- Created on-the-fly for specific tasks
- Temporary workers for one-time jobs
- Example: Create 10 agents to summarize these meeting notes
- Use case: Parallel processing of similar tasks

**Custom Sub-Agents (Module 1.5):**
- Pre-built personas you call repeatedly
- Permanent team members with expertise
- Example: 👨‍💻 Engineer, review this technical spec
- Use case: Specialized perspectives you need regularly

**When to use which:**

| Scenario | Use This |
|----------|----------|
| Process 20 meeting notes simultaneously | Ad-hoc agents (parallel workers) |
| Get technical feedback on specs weekly | Custom sub-agent (Engineer) |
| Research 5 competitors at once | Ad-hoc agents (one-time research) |
| Convert updates to exec summaries regularly | Custom sub-agent (Executive) |
| Analyze 50 user interviews in parallel | Ad-hoc agents (batch processing) |
| Get UX perspective on designs repeatedly | Custom sub-agent (User Researcher) |

**The key difference:** Ad-hoc agents are for DOING many things in parallel. Custom sub-agents are for getting SPECIALIZED PERSPECTIVES you need repeatedly.


## 🗂️ Setup Guide: Accessing the .claude/agents/ Folder

Custom sub-agents live in the hidden `.claude/agents/` folder.

### On Mac

Press **Cmd+Shift+.** in Finder to show hidden files, then navigate to your project folder and open `.claude/agents/`

### On Windows

In File Explorer, click **View** tab → Check **Hidden items**, then navigate to your project folder and open `.claude/agents/`

**Note:** Obsidian can't display hidden folders. Use Finder/Explorer or VS Code to edit `.claude/` files.


## 📄 Sub-Agent File Structure

Each sub-agent is a simple markdown file with three sections:

### Anatomy of a Sub-Agent File

```markdown
# [Emoji] [Name]

## Color
[color-name]

## Persona
[Background, expertise, communication style - 2-3 paragraphs]

## Expertise
- [Skill 1]
- [Skill 2]
- [Skill 3]
- [etc.]
```

### Example: Engineer Sub-Agent

```markdown
# 👨‍💻 Engineer

## Color
purple

## Persona
You are an experienced software engineer with 10+ years at top tech companies
(Google, Meta, startups). You think deeply about technical architecture,
scalability, performance, and implementation details.

When analyzing features or specs, you provide:
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Implementation complexity estimates
- Potential challenges and edge cases
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Concrete, specific recommendations

Your communication style:
- Direct and pragmatic
- Focus on whats technically possible vs ideal
- Flag risks early
- Suggest alternatives when something wont work
- Balance perfectionism with shipping

You help PMs write better technical specs by spotting gaps, ambiguities,
and technical challenges they might miss.

## Expertise
- System architecture and design patterns
- API design and database schema
- Performance optimization and scalability
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Spotting edge cases and error states
- Implementation complexity estimation
```

**Key elements:**
- **Emoji & Name:** Appears in terminal when called
- **Color:** Visual distinction (purple, blue, green, red, yellow, cyan, magenta)
- **Persona:** 2-4 paragraphs describing background, expertise, and communication style
- **Expertise:** Bulleted list of specific skills


## 🛠️ Creating Your First Sub-Agent

Lets create a QA Tester sub-agent from scratch.

### Step 1: Navigate to .claude/agents/ Folder

Use the methods above to open your projects `.claude/agents/` folder in Finder/Explorer.

### Step 2: Create New File

Create a new file named: `qa-tester.md`

**Naming convention:**
- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens for spaces
- End with `.md`
- Example: `data-analyst.md`, `tech-writer.md`, `growth-pm.md`

### Step 3: Write the Persona

Copy this template and customize:

```markdown
# 🔍 QA Tester

## Color
red

## Persona
You are a meticulous QA professional with 8+ years of experience testing enterprise
software at companies like Microsoft, Atlassian, and fast-growing startups. You think
comprehensively about edge cases, error states, and user error scenarios that others
miss.

When reviewing features or user stories, you provide:
- Comprehensive test case generation
- Edge case identification (the weird scenarios no one thinks about)
- Error state analysis (what happens when things go wrong)
- Accessibility and usability testing considerations
- Cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility concerns

Your communication style:
- Thorough and detail-oriented
- Constructively critical (you spot problems early)
- Organized (you categorize issues by severity)
- Practical (you suggest solutions, not just problems)
- User-advocate (you think like end users making mistakes)

You help PMs ship higher quality products by catching issues before they reach users.

## Expertise
- Test case generation and test plan creation
- Edge case and error state identification
- Acceptance criteria validation
- User error scenario analysis
- Regression testing strategy
- Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)
- Cross-browser and device compatibility
- Load and performance testing considerations
```

### Step 4: Save and Test

Save the file, then test in Claude Code:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Call your new sub-agent
🔍 QA Tester, review these user stories in @user-stories.md and identify
potential edge cases and missing test scenarios
```

You should see red-colored output with the QA emoji!

**Tip:** Run `/agents` in Claude Code to see all your configured sub-agents at any time.

## 💡 Best Practices

**Persona Design:**
- Give specific background and expertise (not generic "you are helpful")
- Define clear communication style
- Make them feel like a real person with 2-4 paragraphs


**When to Create Custom Sub-Agents:**
- You need the same perspective weekly or more
- For specialized expertise you use repeatedly
- Building consistent team workflows


## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Can't see .claude/ folder?**
- Mac: Press Cmd+Shift+. in Finder
- Windows: Enable "Hidden items" in File Explorer

**Sub-agent not responding?**
- Include the emoji: `👨‍💻 Engineer, review this`
- Check file is in `.claude/agents/` and ends in `.md`
- Restart Claude (`exit` then `claude`)

**Call multiple sub-agents:**
```
👨‍💻 Engineer, review @spec.md for technical feasibility.
Then 🔍 QA Tester, review it for test coverage.
```
