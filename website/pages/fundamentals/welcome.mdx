**Key takeaway:** This is a hands-on course where youll do real PM work for TaskFlow using Claude Code.


## 🏢 What is TaskFlow?

### Company Overview

**TaskFlow** is a fictional project management SaaS company created for this course. Think **Asana meets Jira, built for remote-first teams.**

**Company Details:**

## 📂 Course File Structure

When youre working in the TaskFlow course, heres what youll find:

```
claude-code-pm-course/
├── company-context/
│   ├── COMPANY.md - Company overview and your role
│   ├── PRODUCT.md - What TaskFlow does
│   ├── PERSONAS.md - The 3 user personas

```

**Note:** The `.claude/` folder (for commands, agents, settings) exists but is hidden. Youll work with it in later modules.


## 🎓 How the Course Works

### Two Parts

**1. Interactive Modules (What youre doing now)**
- Complete modules using Claude Code
- Each starts with a slash command: `/start-1-1`, `/start-1-2`, etc.
- Claude guides you step-by-step through exercises
- You actually DO the work (not just read about it)
- Real PM tasks for TaskFlow

**2. Reference Guides (What youre reading now)**
- Comprehensive standalone guides for each module
- Can be read on the website without using Claude Code
- Use them when you need deeper explanation
- Great for review and reference later

### Learning Paths

**Path A: Interactive (Recommended)**
- Do all modules in Claude Code
- Type `/start-X-X` to begin each module
- Claude teaches you step-by-step

**Path B: Self-Study**
- Read all reference guides first
- Get full understanding before trying in Claude Code
- Good for people who like to understand concepts first

**Path C: Hybrid**
- Read reference guide first
- Then do interactive module
- Combines depth with practice

### Course Structure

**5 Levels:**
1. **Level 1: Foundation** - Get up and running (youre here!)
2. **Level 2: Practitioner** - Daily PM workflows
3. **Level 3: Power User** - Automation & customization
4. **Level 4: Expert** - Advanced integrations
5. **Level 5: Master** - Build your Product OS

**What Youll Learn in Level 1:**
- Module 1.1: Welcome to TaskFlow (this module)
- Module 1.2: Visualizing Files with Obsidian
- Module 1.3: Reading & Writing Files
- Module 1.4: Agents for Parallel Work
- Module 1.5: Custom Sub-Agents
- Module 1.6: Project Memory (CLAUDE.md)


## ⏱️ Time Commitment

**Per Module:** 15-30 minutes
**Per Level:** 2-4 hours
**Full Course:** 20-30 hours

**But:** You can go at your own pace!
- Do one module at a time
- Take breaks between levels
- Come back anytime (progress is saved)


## 🛠️ What You Need

### Required:
- ✅ Claude Pro or Max subscription (you already have this!)
- ✅ Terminal access (Mac Terminal, Windows PowerShell)
- ✅ Willingness to try things and learn by doing

### NOT Required:
- ❌ Coding skills (this is for PMs, not engineers!)
- ❌ Terminal expertise (Claude handles the technical stuff)
- ❌ Your own documents (all files are pre-created for you)


## 💬 No Terminal Commands Needed!

### You Just Talk to Claude

One of the best parts: **You dont need to know terminal commands.**

**Bad course approach:**
Type `ls -la` to list files, `cd` to change directory, `pwd` to see where you are...

**This course approach:**
Hey Claude, show me what files we have.

Claude handles all the technical commands. You just talk in plain English!

### What You Will See

Throughout the course, youll see Claude running commands like:

```
⏺ Read(company-context/COMPANY.md)
  ⎿  Read 45 lines

⏺ Bash(ls -la company-context/)
  ⎿  Listed 4 files
```

**Dont worry about understanding those!** Theyre Claude working behind the scenes. You just focus on the PM work.

### Permission Prompts

Occasionally, youll see prompts asking:
Do you want to allow this command?

**Just click:** Yes and dont ask again

This lets Claude work smoothly without asking permission every time.


## 📋 Best Practices

### As You Go Through Modules:

**✅ Do:**
- Complete modules in order (they build on each other)
- Actually DO the exercises (dont just read)
- Take breaks when needed
- Ask questions if confused
- Reference the guides when stuck

**❌ Dont:**
- Skip modules (youll miss important concepts)
- Rush through (take your time to understand)
- Get frustrated (its okay to not understand everything immediately)
- Be afraid to experiment (you cant break anything!)

### Pro Tips:

1. **Set aside focused time** - Modules need attention, not multitasking
2. **Have Obsidian ready** - Youll set it up in Module 1.2
3. **Keep notes** - Jot down questions or insights as you go
4. **Celebrate progress** - Youre learning a powerful skill!


## 🎯 Why This Course Matters

### The PM Productivity Problem

**Before Claude Code:**
- Meeting notes pile up, never get processed
- User research sits unanalyzed for weeks
- Documentation is always out of date
- Competitive research is tedious and slow
- Stakeholder updates take hours to write

**After This Course:**
- Process 10 meetings in 5 minutes with agents
- Analyze research in real-time
- Auto-generate documentation
- Parallel competitive research
- Transform notes into polished updates instantly

**Time saved:** 10-20 hours per week

**Value:** More time for strategy, user conversations, and actual product thinking instead of documentation drudgery.


## 🚀 Whats Next?

### After Module 1.1

You now understand:
- ✅ What TaskFlow is (your fictional company)
- ✅ How the course works (interactive + reference guides)
- ✅ That you just talk to Claude (no terminal expertise needed)
- ✅ The structure of files and modules

**Ready for Module 1.2?**

Module 1.2 teaches you how to set up Obsidian so you can SEE the files Claude creates while you work. Its optional but highly recommended - having a visual workspace makes everything clearer.

**[Go to Module 1.2 Reference →](🎨%20Content%20Creation/🏭%20Development/Claude%20Code%20Definitive%20Guide/claude-code-pm-course/lesson-modules/1.2-visualizing-files/REFERENCE_GUIDE.md)**

Or, if youre doing the interactive track:
```
Type: /start-1-2
```


## ❓ Common Questions

### Do I need to install anything?

Just Obsidian (Module 1.2), which is free. Everything else is already set up in the course repository.

### What if I dont understand something?

Ask Claude! Thats what its there for. You can also check these reference guides anytime.

### Can I skip modules?

Not recommended. Each module builds on previous ones. Skipping Module 1.3 will make Module 1.4 confusing.

### How long does the full course take?

20-30 hours total, but you can go at your own pace. Some people do one module per day (30 min/day), others binge a whole level on weekends.

### Is this for non-technical PMs?

YES! This is specifically designed for PMs who dont code. You wont need to write code or understand terminal commands. Its all about PM work.

### What if I get stuck?

- Ask Claude for help in the session
- Check the reference guide for that module
- Take a break and come back
- Review the previous module if needed

### Can I use this for real work?

Absolutely! After Level 1, you can start using Claude Code for your actual PM work. The TaskFlow exercises teach you patterns youll use every day.


## ✨ Youre Ready!

You now have:
- ✅ Understanding of TaskFlow (the company)
- ✅ Knowledge of the 3 user personas
- ✅ Course structure clarity
