## 🎓 How the Course Works

### Two Parts

**1. Interactive Modules (What youre doing now)**
- Complete modules using Claude Code
- Each starts with a slash command: `/start-1-1`, `/start-1-2`, etc.
- Claude guides you step-by-step through exercises
- You actually DO the work (not just read about it)
- Real PM tasks for TaskFlow

**2. Reference Guides (What youre reading now)**
- Comprehensive standalone guides for each module
- Can be read on the website without using Claude Code
- Use them when you need deeper explanation
- Great for review and reference later

### Learning Paths

**Path A: Interactive (Recommended)**
- Do all modules in Claude Code
- Type `/start-X-X` to begin each module
- Claude teaches you step-by-step

**Path B: Self-Study**
- Read all reference guides first
- Get full understanding before trying in Claude Code
- Good for people who like to understand concepts first

**Path C: Hybrid**
- Read reference guide first
- Then do interactive module
- Combines depth with practice

### Course Structure

**Module 1: Fundamentals** - Core concepts and workflows
**Module 2: Advanced** - Real PM work (PRDs, data analysis, strategy)


## ⏱️ Time Commitment

**Per Module:** 15-30 minutes
**Per Level:** 2-4 hours
**Full Course:** 20-30 hours

**But:** You can go at your own pace!
- Do one module at a time
- Take breaks between levels
- Come back anytime (progress is saved)

### What You Will See

Throughout the course, youll see Claude running commands like:

```
⏺ Read(company-context/COMPANY.md)
  ⎿  Read 45 lines

⏺ Bash(ls -la company-context/)
  ⎿  Listed 4 files
```

**Dont worry about understanding those!** Theyre Claude working behind the scenes. You just focus on the PM work.

### Permission Prompts

Occasionally, youll see prompts asking:
Do you want to allow this command?

**Just click:** Yes and dont ask again

This lets Claude work smoothly without asking permission every time.


## 📋 Best Practices

**Do:**
- Complete modules in order
- Actually do the exercises
- Take breaks when needed

**Don't:**
- Skip modules
- Rush through
- Get frustrated with yourself

## ❓ Common Questions

**Do I need to install anything?**
Just Obsidian (Module 1.2), which is free.

**Can I skip modules?**
Not recommended. Each module builds on previous ones.

**How long does the full course take?**
15-25 hours total, at your own pace.

**Is this for non-technical PMs?**
YES! No coding required.

**Can I use this for real work?**
Absolutely. After Module 1, you can apply these patterns to your actual PM work.
