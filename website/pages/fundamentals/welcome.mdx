 - **Prerequisites:** Claude Code installed


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-1` to kick off the interactive experience.

## ▶️ Reminder on How to Get Started

⚠️ **If you haven't cloned the repository yet:** Go back to [Module 0.2: Start Claude Code & Clone the Course](/getting-started/start-and-clone) first. You'll need the course files on your computer to continue.


**There are two ways to launch this course in Claude Code:**

### Option One: Find it in the File Explorer

Navigate to your Documents folder and find the `claude-code-pm-course` folder. Then right-click and select "New Terminal at Folder"

It will look something like this:

![Opening folder from file explorer](/images/folder-location.png)

Then type `claude` and hit Enter

### Option Two: Open it from the Terminal

Type these commands into your terminal:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/claude-code-pm-course
claude
```

This navigates to your course folder and opens Claude Code directly inside it.

**Either way, you end up at the same place. Then, to start this module:**

> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-1` to kick off the interactive experience.

This is how you will start every module!

## 📖 Overview

Module 1.1 is your introduction to the Claude Code PM Course. Youll learn what TaskFlow is (the fictional company youll work for), how the course works, and get oriented with the files and structure.

**Key takeaway:** This is a hands-on course where youll do real PM work for TaskFlow using Claude Code.


## 🏢 What is TaskFlow?

### Company Overview

**TaskFlow** is a fictional project management SaaS company created for this course. Think **Asana meets Jira, built for remote-first teams.**

**Company Details:**
- **Founded:** 2021

**Note:** The `.claude/` folder (for commands, agents, settings) exists but is hidden. Youll work with it in later modules.


## 🎓 How the Course Works

### Two Parts

**1. Interactive Modules (What youre doing now)**
- Complete modules using Claude Code
- Each starts with a slash command: `/start-1-1`, `/start-1-2`, etc.
- Claude guides you step-by-step through exercises
- You actually DO the work (not just read about it)
- Real PM tasks for TaskFlow

**2. Reference Guides (What youre reading now)**
- Comprehensive standalone guides for each module
- Can be read on the website without using Claude Code
- Use them when you need deeper explanation
- Great for review and reference later

### Learning Paths

**Path A: Interactive (Recommended)**
- Do all modules in Claude Code
- Type `/start-X-X` to begin each module
- Claude teaches you step-by-step

**Path B: Self-Study**
- Read all reference guides first
- Get full understanding before trying in Claude Code
- Good for people who like to understand concepts first

**Path C: Hybrid**
- Read reference guide first
- Then do interactive module
- Combines depth with practice

### Course Structure

**3 Modules:**
1. **Module 1: Fundamentals** - Get up and running (you're here!)
2. **Module 2: Advanced PM Work** - Daily PM workflows
3. **Module 3: Advanced Claude Code Workflows** - All the features (coming soon)

**What You'll Learn in Module 1:**
- Module 1.1: Welcome to TaskFlow (this module)
- Module 1.2: Visualizing Files with Obsidian
- Module 1.3: Reading & Writing Files
- Module 1.4: Agents for Parallel Work
- Module 1.5: Custom Sub-Agents
- Module 1.6: Project Memory (CLAUDE.md)
- Module 1.7: Claude Code Navigation


## ⏱️ Time Commitment

**Per Module:** 15-30 minutes
**Per Level:** 2-4 hours
**Full Course:** 20-30 hours

**But:** You can go at your own pace!
- Do one module at a time
- Take breaks between levels
- Come back anytime (progress is saved)

### What You Will See

Throughout the course, youll see Claude running commands like:

```
⏺ Read(company-context/COMPANY.md)
  ⎿  Read 45 lines

⏺ Bash(ls -la company-context/)
  ⎿  Listed 4 files
```

**Dont worry about understanding those!** Theyre Claude working behind the scenes. You just focus on the PM work.

### Permission Prompts

Occasionally, youll see prompts asking:
Do you want to allow this command?

**Just click:** Yes and dont ask again

This lets Claude work smoothly without asking permission every time.


## 📋 Best Practices

### As You Go Through Modules:

**✅ Do:**
- Complete modules in order (they build on each other)
- Actually DO the exercises (dont just read)
- Take breaks when needed
- Ask questions if confused
- Reference the guides when stuck

**❌ Dont:**
- Skip modules (youll miss important concepts)
- Rush through (take your time to understand)
- Get frustrated (its okay to not understand everything immediately)
- Be afraid to experiment (you cant break anything!)

### Pro Tips:

1. **Set aside focused time** - Modules need attention, not multitasking
2. **Have Obsidian ready** - Youll set it up in Module 1.2
3. **Keep notes** - Jot down questions or insights as you go
4. **Celebrate progress** - Youre learning a powerful skill!

## ❓ Common Questions

### Do I need to install anything?

Just Obsidian (Module 1.2), which is free. Everything else is already set up in the course repository.

### What if I dont understand something?

Ask Claude! Thats what its there for. You can also check these reference guides anytime.

### Can I skip modules?

Not recommended. Each module builds on previous ones. Skipping Module 1.3 will make Module 1.4 confusing.

### How long does the full course take?

20-30 hours total, but you can go at your own pace. Some people do one module per day (30 min/day), others binge a whole level on weekends.

### Is this for non-technical PMs?

YES! This is specifically designed for PMs who dont code. You wont need to write code or understand terminal commands. Its all about PM work.

### What if I get stuck?

- Ask Claude for help in the session
- Check the reference guide for that module
- Take a break and come back
- Review the previous module if needed

### Can I use this for real work?

Absolutely! After Level 1, you can start using Claude Code for your actual PM work. The TaskFlow exercises teach you patterns youll use every day.
