## 1.7: Claude Code Navigation

 - **Time to Complete:** 15-20 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Modules 1.1-1.6 complete


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-7` to kick off the interactive experience.

## üìñ Overview

Module 1.7 covers the final navigation essentials: input modes, analysis depth control, and workflow acceleration. These skills separate casual users from power users.

**What you'll learn:**
1. **Input modes** - Edit, auto-accept, and plan mode
2. **Think keywords** - Control analysis depth (think/think harder/ultrathink)
3. **--dangerously-skip-permissions** - Critical workflow accelerator

**Key takeaway:** Master when to use each mode, adjust analysis depth on demand, and remove friction from workflows.


## üéõÔ∏è The Three Input Modes

Claude Code has three input modes that control workflow execution:

| Mode | Behavior | Best For | Switch Method |
|------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Edit** (Default) | Shows diffs, waits for approval | Critical files, learning, safety | Press Shift+Tab |
| **Auto-Accept** | Applies changes immediately | Simple tasks, trusted operations | Press Shift+Tab |
| **Plan** | Creates structured plan with todos first | Multi-step workflows, complex research | Press Shift+Tab |

**Switching:** Press **Shift+Tab** to cycle through modes anytime.

### Edit Mode (Default)

Shows every file change before applying. You review and approve each change.

**Use when:**
- Working with critical files
- Learning how Claude approaches tasks
- Need control and review

### Auto-Accept Mode

Automatically applies changes without asking. Fast and autonomous.

**Use when:**
- Task is straightforward and clear
- Trust Claude to execute correctly
- Want speed over review

### Plan Mode

Creates structured plan with auto-generated todo list before executing. See strategy upfront.

**Use when:**
- Complex, multi-step workflows (3+ distinct steps)
- Want to see strategy before execution
- Research ‚Üí synthesis ‚Üí deliverable workflows
- Multiple agents need coordination

**Example todo list:**
```
‚òê Research TaskFlow's main competitors
‚òê Launch parallel agents to analyze AI features
‚òê Synthesize findings into competitive analysis
‚òê Create response strategy document
```

As Claude works:
```
‚úì Research TaskFlow's main competitors
‚Üí Launch parallel agents to analyze AI features
‚òê Synthesize findings into competitive analysis
‚òê Create response strategy document
```


## üéØ Mode Selection Guide

| Task | Recommended Mode | Why |
|------|------------------|-----|
| Research 5 competitors and create strategy | Plan Mode | Complex, multi-step, benefits from visibility |
| Add dark mode toggle | Auto-Accept/Edit | Simple, one-step task |
| Fix typo in README | Auto-Accept/Edit | Simple, low-risk |
| Create PRD from rough notes | Plan Mode | Multi-step: research ‚Üí outline ‚Üí draft |
| Analyze CSV file | Auto-Accept | Straightforward analysis |
| Multi-source research synthesis | Plan Mode | Complex: agents ‚Üí synthesis |

**Quick Decision Tree:**
1. Complex multi-step workflow? ‚Üí **Plan Mode**
2. Straightforward and low-risk? ‚Üí **Auto-Accept**
3. Otherwise ‚Üí **Edit Mode** (safest)


## üí° Think Control Keywords

Adjust analysis depth before Claude responds:

| Keyword | Depth | When to Use |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `think about X` | Normal | Most tasks |
| `think harder about X` | Deeper | Complex decisions |
| `ultrathink about X` | Maximum | Really hard problems (displays as rainbow!) |

**Examples:**

With plan mode:
```
Think harder about competitive threats, then research competitors' AI features
and create response strategy
```

With any mode:
```
Ultrathink about whether we should build or buy this feature
```

**Pro tip:** Think keywords work in all input modes, especially useful in plan mode for complex strategy work.


## ‚ö° Dangerously Skip Permissions

### The Flag

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**What it does:** Skips all permission prompts. Claude executes commands without approval.

**The transformation:**

| Without Flag | With Flag |
|--------------|-----------|
| Can I write to user-story-1.md? ‚Üí Yes<br/>Can I write to user-story-2.md? ‚Üí Yes<br/>Can I write to user-story-3.md? ‚Üí Yes<br/>[Repeat for every file...] | [Creates all 5 files immediately]<br/>Done! |

### Why It's Worth It

**The tradeoff:**
- **Risk:** No safety net, commands execute immediately
- **Reward:** Pure flow state, 10x faster, real workflow speed

### Carl's Strong Recommendation

**Use it** once you've completed Level 1 and trust Claude Code. The speed gains are worth it.

**Create a shell alias:**
```bash
alias cc="claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
```

Then just type `cc` to start Claude Code in fast mode.

**When to use:**
- Completed Level 1
- Trust Claude Code
- Working in safe environment
- Want professional speed

**When to avoid:**
- Production code
- Unsure what Claude will do
- Learning new project


## üõë Stopping Execution

**Press Esc at any time** to stop Claude from executing.

**What happens:**
- Execution stops immediately
- Files created so far remain
- Can review and decide next steps

**Pro tip:** In plan mode, press Esc once you've seen the value, then review files when ready.


## üí° Best Practices

**Do:**
- Use plan mode for multi-step workflows (3+ steps)
- Switch modes based on task complexity
- Use think keywords for deeper analysis on complex decisions

**Don't:**
- Use plan mode for simple tasks (overkill)
- Stay in one mode all the time (be flexible)
- Forget Esc stops execution

**Workflow Development:**
- **Week 1:** Edit mode for everything (learn how Claude works)
- **Week 2:** Auto-accept for simple tasks
- **Week 3:** Plan mode for complex workflows
- **Week 4:** Natural mode switching based on task


## ‚ùì Common Questions

**When should I use plan mode vs just asking Claude to do it?**

Use plan mode when task has 3+ distinct steps or involves research ‚Üí synthesis ‚Üí deliverable. Skip for simple, obvious tasks.

**Can I edit the plan before Claude executes?**

Yes! Ask to adjust: "Add a step to..." or "Remove the X part" work perfectly.

**Should I always use --dangerously-skip-permissions?**

Use when you trust Claude and speed matters. Avoid for production code or when learning new projects.

**Do think keywords work in all modes?**

Yes! They adjust analysis depth in edit, auto-accept, and plan modes.
