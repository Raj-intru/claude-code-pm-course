## 1.7: Claude Code Navigation Reference

 - **Time to Complete:** 15-20 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Modules 1.1-1.6 complete


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-7` to kick off the interactive experience.

## üìñ Overview

This is the final module of Level 1: Foundation. Youve learned file operations, agents, sub-agents, output styles, and project memory. Now youre learning the **last essential navigation skills** you need for complete Claude Code mastery.

**What youll master in this module:**
1. **Input modes** - Three ways to control Claudes workflow (edit, auto-accept, plan)
2. **Think keywords** - How to adjust analysis depth on demand
3. **--dangerously-skip-permissions** - Critical workflow accelerator

These are the final pieces of the foundation puzzle. After this, youll have complete control over Claude Codes workflow.

**Key takeaway:** Mastering navigation means knowing when to use each mode, how to adjust analysis depth, and how to remove friction from your workflow. These skills separate beginners from masters.


## üéõÔ∏è The Three Input Modes

Claude Code has three input modes that control how it handles your requests:

### 1. Edit Mode (Default)

**What it does:** Shows you every file change before applying it. You review and approve each change.

**When to use:**
- You want control and review
- Youre working with critical files
- Youre learning how Claude approaches tasks
- Default for safety

**Example:**
```
You: Update the README with installation instructions
Claude: Creates the changes ‚Üí Shows you the diff ‚Üí Waits for approval
You: Approve or reject each change
```

### 2. Auto-Accept Mode

**What it does:** Automatically applies changes without asking. Fast and autonomous.

**When to use:**
- Task is straightforward and clear
- You trust Claude to execute correctly
- You want speed over review
- Simple, one-step operations

**Example:**
```
You: Add a dark mode toggle to settings
Claude: Creates and applies the change immediately ‚Üí Done
```

### 3. Plan Mode

**What it does:** Claude creates a structured plan and breaks it into todos before executing. You see the strategy upfront.

**When to use:**
- Complex, multi-step workflows
- You want to see the strategy before execution
- Work involves research ‚Üí synthesis ‚Üí deliverable
- Multiple agents need coordination

**Example:**
```
You: Research competitors AI features and create response strategy
Claude: Creates plan with steps ‚Üí Shows auto-generated todo list ‚Üí You approve ‚Üí Executes while updating todos
```


## üîÑ Switching Between Modes

**How to switch:** Press **Shift+Tab** to cycle through the input modes.

```
Edit Mode ‚Üí (Shift+Tab) ‚Üí Auto-Accept Mode ‚Üí (Shift+Tab) ‚Üí Plan Mode ‚Üí (Shift+Tab) ‚Üí Edit Mode
```

Youll see the current mode indicator in the Claude Code interface.

**Pro tip:** You can switch modes anytime during a session based on what youre working on.


## üìã Planning Mode Deep Dive

### How Plan Mode Works

1. **You request a complex task** (in plan mode)
2. **Claude analyzes the request** and breaks it into logical steps
3. **Claude creates a structured plan** with auto-generated todo list
4. **You approve the plan** (or ask for adjustments)
5. **Claude executes step-by-step** while updating todos in real-time
6. **You can stop anytime** by pressing Esc

### Auto-Generated Todo Lists

When Claude creates a plan, it automatically generates a todo list showing:

- All major steps in the workflow
- Current status (pending/in progress/complete)
- Progress through the plan

**Example todo list:**
```
‚òê Research TaskFlows main competitors
‚òê Launch parallel agents to analyze AI features
‚òê Synthesize findings into competitive analysis
‚òê Create response strategy document
```

As Claude works, youll see:
```
‚úì Research TaskFlows main competitors
‚Üí Launch parallel agents to analyze AI features
‚òê Synthesize findings into competitive analysis
‚òê Create response strategy document
```

### When Planning Mode Shines

**Perfect for plan mode:**
- Competitive research with synthesis
- Multi-source data analysis
- PRD creation from rough ideas
- Complex feature planning
- Research ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Strategy workflows

**Overkill for plan mode:**
- Fix a typo
- Add a simple UI element
- Read a file
- Quick edits

### The Competitive Threat Scenario

The module demonstrates plan mode with a realistic PM scenario:

**Scenario:** A competitor just launched an AI chat feature. Your exec team is panicking. You need to:
1. Research who your competitors are
2. Launch parallel agents to analyze each competitors AI feature
3. Synthesize findings into a competitive analysis
4. Create a response strategy

**Why this demonstrates plan modes value:**
- Multi-step workflow (research ‚Üí agents ‚Üí synthesis ‚Üí strategy)
- Urgent and complex (realistic PM fire drill)
- Benefits from seeing the plan upfront
- Todo list provides visibility into progress


## üí° Think Control Keywords

Claude Code supports think control keywords that adjust how deeply Claude analyzes before responding:

### The Three Levels

**1. think about X**
- Normal thinking
- Standard analysis depth
- Use for most tasks

**2. think harder about X**
- Deeper analysis
- More thorough consideration
- Use for complex decisions

**3. ultrathink about X**
- Maximum depth thinking
- Extensive analysis
- Use for really hard problems
- **Bonus:** Ultrathink displays as an awesome RAINBOW!

### When to Use Think Keywords

**With plan mode:**
```
Think harder about the competitive threats, then research our competitors AI features and create response strategy
```

Claude will do deeper analysis before creating the plan.

**With any mode:**
```
Ultrathink about whether we should build or buy this feature
```

Claude will provide maximum-depth analysis of the decision.

**Pro tip:** Think keywords work in any input mode, but theyre especially useful in plan mode for complex strategy work.


## ‚ö° Critical Workflow Accelerator: Dangerously Skip Permissions

### Why This Matters

This isnt just an advanced tip - this is a **critical workflow accelerator** that Carl (the course creator) strongly recommends.

### The Flag

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**What it does:** Skips all permission prompts. Claude executes commands without asking for approval every time.

**The transformation:**

**Without the flag:**
```
You: Create 5 user stories
Claude: Can I write to user-story-1.md?
You: Yes
Claude: Can I write to user-story-2.md?
You: Yes
Claude: Can I write to user-story-3.md?
You: Yes
[Repeat for every file...]
```

**With the flag:**
```
You: Create 5 user stories
Claude: [Creates all 5 files immediately]
Done!
```

### Why Its Called Dangerously

**The risk:**
- No safety net
- Commands execute immediately
- Claude cant ask Are you sure?
- Mistakes happen faster

**Why its worth it:**
- **Pure flow state** - No interruptions
- **10x faster** - No permission friction
- **Real workflow** - How youll actually work once you trust Claude

### Carls Strong Recommendation

**Use it.** The speed gains are worth it once you understand Claude Code.

**When youre ready:**
- Youve completed Level 1
- You trust Claude Code
- You want professional speed
- Youre working in a safe project

**How to use it:**
```bash
# Instead of:
claude

# Use:
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Pro tip:** Create a shell alias:
```bash
alias cc=claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Then just type `cc` to start Claude Code in fast mode.

### The Philosophy

Claude Code is designed for **trust and speed**. The permission prompts are training wheels. Once you understand how Claude works, remove the training wheels and fly.

This is your final navigation skill. Use it wisely.


## üéØ Mode Selection Guide

### Quick Decision Tree

**Is it a complex, multi-step workflow?**
- YES ‚Üí Use **Plan Mode**
- NO ‚Üí Continue...

**Is it straightforward and low-risk?**
- YES ‚Üí Use **Auto-Accept Mode**
- NO ‚Üí Use **Edit Mode** (safest)

### Examples by Mode

| Task | Recommended Mode | Why |
|------|------------------|-----|
| Research 5 competitors and create strategy | Plan Mode | Complex, multi-step, benefits from todo visibility |
| Add dark mode toggle | Auto-Accept or Edit | Simple, one-step task |
| Fix typo in README | Auto-Accept or Edit | Simple, low-risk |
| Create PRD from rough notes | Plan Mode | Multi-step: research ‚Üí outline ‚Üí draft ‚Üí review |
| Analyze CSV file | Auto-Accept | Straightforward analysis |
| Multi-source research synthesis | Plan Mode | Complex: multiple agents ‚Üí synthesis |


## üõë Stopping Execution

**Press Esc at any time** to stop Claude from executing.

**When to use:**
- Youve seen enough of the plan execution
- You want to adjust the approach
- You realize something needs to change
- You just want to pause

**What happens:**
- Execution stops immediately
- Files created so far remain
- You can review whats been done
- You can continue or change direction

**Pro tip:** In plan mode, you dont need to watch the entire execution. Press Esc once youve seen the value, then review the files when youre ready.


## üìù Real-World Workflow

### Typical PM Session with Planning Mode

**Morning:** Competitor launches new feature

```
1. Open Claude Code in your project
2. Press Shift+Tab to switch to Plan Mode
3. Request: Research how Asana, Monday, and ClickUp handle AI chat features and create competitive analysis with response strategy
4. Claude creates plan with todo list
5. Approve plan
6. Watch todos update as Claude works (or press Esc and review later)
7. Review final strategy document
8. Share with team
```

**Time saved:** What would take 4-6 hours of manual research ‚Üí 15 minutes with plan mode

### Building Muscle Memory

**Week 1:** Use edit mode for everything (learn how Claude works)

**Week 2:** Start using auto-accept for simple tasks

**Week 3:** Try plan mode for one complex workflow

**Week 4:** Naturally switch between modes based on task complexity

Youll develop intuition for which mode fits which task.


## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### Do:
- ‚úÖ Use plan mode for multi-step workflows
- ‚úÖ Watch the todo list update (it shows progress)
- ‚úÖ Press Esc if youve seen enough
- ‚úÖ Use think keywords in plan mode for deeper analysis
- ‚úÖ Switch modes freely based on task complexity

### Dont:
- ‚ùå Use plan mode for simple tasks (overkill)
- ‚ùå Stay in one mode all the time (be flexible)
- ‚ùå Forget you can stop execution with Esc
- ‚ùå Feel like you need to use plan mode for everything


## ‚ùì Common Questions

### When should I use plan mode vs just asking Claude to do it?

**Use plan mode when:**
- Task has 3+ distinct steps
- You want to see the strategy first
- Work involves research ‚Üí synthesis ‚Üí deliverable
- Youd benefit from todo visibility

**Skip plan mode when:**
- Task is simple and obvious
- One clear step to completion
- You just want it done fast

### Can I edit the plan before Claude executes it?

Yes! When Claude shows you the plan, you can ask to adjust it before execution. Add a step to... or Remove the X part work perfectly.

### What happens if I press Esc during execution?

Execution stops immediately. Files created up to that point remain. You can review them and decide whether to continue, adjust, or start over.

### Should I always use --dangerously-skip-permissions?

Its fast but risky. Use it when:
- Youre in a safe environment
- You trust Claude completely
- You know the project well
- Speed matters more than safety gates

Avoid it when:
- Working with production code
- Unsure what Claude will do
- Learning a new project
- Safety matters most

### Do think keywords work in all modes?

Yes! think about, think harder about, and ultrathink about work in edit mode, auto-accept mode, and plan mode. They just adjust how deeply Claude analyzes before responding.
