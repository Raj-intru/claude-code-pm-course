## 1.3: Your First PM Tasks

 - **Time to Complete:** 30 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Modules 1.1 and 1.2 completed


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-3` to kick off the interactive experience.

## Overview

Module 1.3 teaches you to use Claude Code for real PM work: processing meeting notes, synthesizing research, analyzing visual content, and creating reusable templates. This is where theory becomes practice.

**Key takeaway:** Claude Code is a file-aware, visual-capable assistant that can save you 2-3 hours per week on routine PM documentation tasks.


## Core Capabilities

This module covers five essential skills:

| Capability | What You'll Learn |
|------------|-------------------|
| **File Reading/Writing** | Reference files with `@`, read multiple documents, create/edit files |
| **Content Analysis** | Transform notes into action items, synthesize research, extract patterns |
| **Image Pasting** | Paste screenshots directly into terminal with Ctrl+V (all platforms) |
| **Visual Analysis** | Get feedback on mockups, analyze competitors, review data visualizations |
| **Output Styles** | Create reusable formatting templates for recurring document types |


## The @ Symbol - File Reference System

The `@` symbol tells Claude which files to read, analyze, or reference.

### Basic Syntax

```
Read @meeting-notes.txt and summarize action items
```

```
Compare @competitor-a.md and @competitor-b.md
```

```
Analyze @research/interviews/user-01.txt
```

### Supported File Types

| Format | Extensions | Common Uses |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Markdown | `.md` | PRDs, documentation, notes |
| Text | `.txt` | Meeting notes, raw data |
| CSV | `.csv` | Survey results, metrics |
| JSON | `.json` | API responses, structured data |
| PDF | `.pdf` | Research papers, reports |
| Images | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif` | Screenshots, mockups |

### Working with Multiple Files

**Process batch files:**
```
Read all files in /meetings/ and extract action items
```

**Cross-reference documents:**
```
Read @prd.md and @user-research.md.
Identify gaps where the PRD doesn't address user pain points.
```

**Synthesize from multiple sources:**
```
Read all files in /interviews/ and create @research-synthesis.md with:
- Top 5 pain points
- Common feature requests
- User personas
```


## Pasting Images - Critical Keyboard Shortcut

### The Universal Command: Ctrl+V

**CRITICAL: Use Ctrl+V on ALL platforms, including Mac**

| Platform | Correct | Wrong |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Mac | **Ctrl+V** | Command+V |
| Windows | **Ctrl+V** | - |
| Linux | **Ctrl+V** | - |

**Why is Mac different?** In terminals, `Ctrl+V` is universal across all OS. `Command+V` is Mac's GUI paste and doesn't work in terminal environments.

### How to Paste Images

1. **Copy image to clipboard**
   - Screenshot: `Cmd+Shift+4` (Mac) or `Win+Shift+S` (Windows)
   - Copy from browser/Figma: `Cmd+C` (Mac) or `Ctrl+C` (Windows)

2. **Paste into Claude Code**
   - Press **Ctrl+V** in terminal
   - Image appears in conversation

3. **Request analysis**
   ```
   Analyze this mockup and provide:
   - UX feedback from PM perspective
   - Technical challenges
   - Accessibility concerns
   - Missing user flow elements
   ```

### What You Can Paste

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Design & Product** | Figma mockups, wireframes, user journeys |
| **Data & Analytics** | Dashboard screenshots, charts, metrics |
| **Competitive Research** | Competitor screenshots, pricing pages |
| **Collaboration** | Whiteboard photos, meeting diagrams |
| **Technical** | Error messages, architecture diagrams |


## Content Transformation

A core PM skill is communicating the same information to different audiences.

### Communication Matrix

| Audience | Format | Tone | Focus |
|----------|--------|------|-------|
| Engineering | Slack | Casual, technical | Implementation details |
| Stakeholders | Email | Professional, strategic | Business outcomes |
| Customers | Release notes | Friendly, benefit-focused | Value delivered |
| Documentation | Notion doc | Comprehensive, structured | Complete reference |
| Executives | Brief | Concise, metric-driven | Impact and next steps |

### Example: Multi-Format Communication

```
Read @sprint-planning-notes.txt and create:
1. @slack-update.md - Casual team announcement
2. @stakeholder-email.md - Professional executive summary
3. @notion-doc.md - Complete reference documentation
```


## Output Styles - Reusable Templates

Output styles are formatting templates that eliminate repetitive formatting explanations.

### Creating an Output Style

**Method 1: Define the format**
```
Create output style Executive Briefing with:
- Maximum 3 paragraphs
- Paragraph 1: What happened (outcomes, metrics)
- Paragraph 2: Why it matters (business impact)
- Paragraph 3: What's next (forward-looking)
- Use bullet points for metrics
- No jargon, active voice
```

**Method 2: Show an example**
```
Create output style User Story formatted like:

**As a** [persona]
**I want** [capability]
**So that** [benefit]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given [context]
  When [action]
  Then [outcome]
```

### Using Output Styles

```
Convert @meeting-notes.txt to Executive Briefing style
```

```
Format @sprint-work.md as Weekly Update style
```

### Essential PM Output Styles

Build your library with these formats:

1. **Executive Briefing** - 3-paragraph strategic summary
2. **User Story** - As a/I want/So that with acceptance criteria
3. **Linear/Jira Issue** - Title, description, ACs, priority, estimate
4. **Weekly Update** - Shipped/In Progress/Blocked/Next Week
5. **Release Notes** - Customer-facing, benefit-focused
6. **PRD Section** - Problem/Solution/Metrics/Stories
7. **Slack Announcement** - Casual, emoji-friendly
8. **Stakeholder Email** - Professional, context-rich


## Real-World PM Workflows

### Meeting Processing (Weekly)

**Without Claude Code:** 35 minutes
- Review notes: 10 min
- Extract action items: 15 min
- Organize by owner: 5 min
- Format for distribution: 5 min

**With Claude Code:** 2 minutes
```
Process all files in /meetings/today/ and create @action-items-summary.md with:
- Table of action items organized by owner
- Priority and due date
- Grouped by meeting source
```

**Time saved:** 33 min/week = 2.75 hours/month

### User Research Synthesis

**Without Claude Code:** 2 hours 40 minutes
- Read 8 transcripts: 60 min
- Highlight themes: 30 min
- Extract quotes: 20 min
- Organize findings: 20 min
- Write synthesis: 30 min

**With Claude Code:** 5 minutes
```
Read all files in /user-interviews/ and create @research-synthesis.md with:
- Top 5 pain points (mentioned by 3+ users)
- Supporting quotes for each finding
- Feature requests ranked by frequency
- Refined personas with real data
- Recommended next steps
```

**Time saved:** 2.5 hours per research cycle

### Stakeholder Communication

**Without Claude Code:** 45 minutes
- Draft Slack message: 10 min
- Write stakeholder email: 15 min
- Create Notion doc: 15 min
- Ensure consistency: 5 min

**With Claude Code:** 3 minutes
```
Read @product-sync-notes.md and create three formats:

1. Slack Update - Casual, emoji-friendly, celebrate wins
2. Stakeholder Email - Business outcomes, metrics, risks
3. Notion Document - Complete reference with dependencies
```

**Time saved:** 42 min/sprint = 1.4 hours/month


## Best Practices

### Do:

**Use @ references explicitly**
```
Good: Read @user-research.md and summarize pain points
Better: Read @user-research.md and create @pain-points-summary.md
```

**Request structured outputs**
```
Create table with: Action Item | Owner | Due Date | Priority
```

**Provide context for analysis**
```
We're deciding between Feature A and B for Q2.
Read @user-research.md and recommend which addresses more critical pain points.
```

**Combine multiple operations**
```
Read all /interviews/, synthesize findings, create @executive-summary.md and @detailed-insights.md
```

**Build output style library gradually**
- Create styles as you encounter repetitive needs
- Don't create all at once


### Don't:

**Forget the @ symbol**
```
Bad: Summarize meeting-notes.txt
Good: Summarize @meeting-notes.txt
```

**Use Command+V on Mac**
- Always use Ctrl+V for images (all platforms)

**Expect Claude to remember unsaved work**
- Save files with filenames for later reference

**Paste sensitive information**
- Redact confidential data from screenshots first

**Create overly complex styles**
- Keep simple and focused
- Better: 10 simple styles than 1 complicated one


## Troubleshooting

**Command+V doesn't work on Mac**
- Solution: Use **Ctrl+V** instead
- Why: Terminals use Ctrl shortcuts across all platforms

**Claude can't find referenced file**
- Check filename spelling (case-sensitive)
- Verify file path: `What files are in /meetings/?`
- Ask Claude: `Does @meeting-notes.txt exist?`

**Image pasted but no analysis**
- Verify image appeared in conversation
- Try different format (.png or .jpg)
- Check size (keep under 10MB)
- Re-paste with Ctrl+V

**Output style not formatting correctly**
- Show concrete example of desired format
- Be specific about structure
- Test and refine iteratively
- Start simple, add complexity gradually

**File created but not visible in Obsidian**
- Refresh Obsidian
- Check it's not in hidden .claude/ folder
- Look in Finder/Explorer
- Ask Claude: `Where did you save the file?`


## What's Next?

**Module 1.4: Agents for Parallel Work**

Learn to clone Claude for simultaneous tasks:
- Process 10 meeting notes in parallel
- Research 5 competitors simultaneously
- Build multi-agent workflows
- Do 5 hours of work in 30 minutes

Interactive track: Type `/start-1-4`


## Quick Reference

**Essential Commands:**
- `@filename` - Reference a file
- `Ctrl+V` - Paste image (all platforms)
- `Read @file and create @output` - Basic workflow

**File Operations:**
```
Single: @meeting-notes.txt
Multiple: @file1.txt, @file2.txt, @file3.txt
Folder: All files in /meetings/
```

**Content Transformation:**
```
Transform @source.txt into:
1. @casual-slack.md - Team-friendly
2. @formal-email.md - Stakeholder-appropriate
3. @comprehensive-doc.md - Complete reference
```

**Output Styles:**
```
Create: Create output style [Name] with rules: [format]
Use: Format @content.txt in [Name] style
```

**Image Analysis:**
1. Copy image (Cmd+Shift+4 / Win+Shift+S)
2. Paste with Ctrl+V
3. Request analysis


## Resources

Practice these workflows during the interactive module (`/start-1-3`) to build muscle memory for file references, image pasting, and output styles.
