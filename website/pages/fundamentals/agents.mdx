## Reference Guide

**Last Updated:** October 13, 2025
**Time to Complete:** 25 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Module 1.3 (File operations and @ references)

## 📖 Overview

Module 1.4 introduces the most powerful feature of Claude Code: **agents**. This is the moment that transforms Claude Code from "helpful AI assistant" into "productivity superpower."

Imagine you have 10 meeting notes to process. Normally, you'd do them one by one - that's 50 minutes of sequential work. With agents, you spin up 10 independent instances of Claude that work simultaneously. Same work, done in 5 minutes.

**Key takeaway:** Agents let you clone Claude to do multiple things at once. This isn't just faster - it unlocks entirely new workflows that would be impractical to do manually.

---

## 🤯 What Are Agents? (The "Aha!" Moment)

### The Core Concept

**Agents are independent instances of Claude that run in parallel.**

Think of it like this:
- **Without agents:** You're one person doing tasks sequentially
- **With agents:** You can clone yourself 5, 10, or 20 times to work simultaneously

### Not Just "Faster" - It's Different

Here's what makes agents revolutionary:

**Before agents (sequential work):**
```
Task 1 (5 min) → Task 2 (5 min) → Task 3 (5 min) → ... → Task 10 (5 min)
Total time: 50 minutes
```

**With agents (parallel work):**
```
Task 1 (5 min) ┐
Task 2 (5 min) │
Task 3 (5 min) ├─→ All happen simultaneously
Task 4 (5 min) │
...            │
Task 10 (5 min)┘
Total time: 5 minutes
```

### The Math That Changes Everything

**Example:** You have 10 meeting recordings from last week to process before your Monday standup.

**Sequential processing:**
- 10 meetings × 5 minutes each = 50 minutes
- You're stressed, rushing, probably skip some

**Parallel processing with agents:**
- 10 agents × 5 minutes = 5 minutes total
- Every meeting processed thoroughly
- You arrive at standup fully prepared

**That's not 10% faster. That's 10x faster.**

### What Makes This Different from Chatbots

**Regular chatbot:**
- One conversation thread
- Sequential processing only
- Can't actually do multiple things at once
- Previous work disappears in chat history

**Claude Code with agents:**
- Multiple independent Claude instances
- True parallel execution
- Each agent can use full tool access
- All work persists in files

### Real-World Impact

Let's say you're a PM who spends time on:
- Processing meeting notes (2 hours/week)
- Competitor research (3 hours/week)
- User research synthesis (4 hours/week)

**With agents, you can:**
- Process 15 meetings in 10 minutes (instead of 2 hours)
- Research 5 competitors simultaneously (instead of sequentially)
- Analyze interviews, surveys, and support tickets in parallel (instead of one at a time)

**Time saved: 8+ hours per week**

---

## 🎯 When to Use Agents (Decision Framework)

### The Agent Decision Tree

```
Do you have multiple independent tasks?
    │
    ├─ NO → Just prompt Claude normally
    │
    └─ YES → Continue ↓

Are the tasks similar (same type of work)?
    │
    ├─ YES → Perfect for agents! Use many agents (5-20)
    │
    └─ SOMEWHAT → Continue ↓

Can tasks be done independently (no dependencies)?
    │
    ├─ YES → Use agents! (2-10 agents with different specializations)
    │
    └─ NO → Sequential work, don't use agents
```

### ✅ Perfect Use Cases for Agents

**1. Batch Processing Similar Tasks**
- Process 10 meeting notes → 10 agents
- Summarize 20 interview transcripts → 20 agents
- Analyze 15 customer support tickets → 15 agents
- Review 8 PRD drafts → 8 agents

**2. Parallel Research**
- Research 5 competitors → 5 agents (one per competitor)
- Analyze 3 market segments → 3 agents
- Review 10 feature requests → 10 agents

**3. Multi-Source Analysis**
- Agent 1: Analyze user interviews
- Agent 2: Process survey data
- Agent 3: Review support tickets
- Agent 4: Analyze social media feedback
- All work in parallel, combine insights at the end

**4. Time-Sensitive Work**
- Need competitive analysis done in 1 hour, not 1 day
- Process all sprint retrospectives before planning meeting
- Synthesize research before stakeholder presentation

### ❌ When NOT to Use Agents

**1. Single Tasks**
```
❌ "Create 1 agent to summarize this file"
✅ Just prompt normally: "Summarize @meeting-notes.txt"
```

**2. Sequential Dependencies**
```
❌ "Agent 1 analyzes, Agent 2 uses Agent 1's output, Agent 3 uses Agent 2's output"
✅ Do this sequentially: "Analyze this, then synthesize, then create recommendations"
```

**3. Small Quick Tasks**
```
❌ "Create 10 agents to each write one sentence"
✅ Just ask Claude: "Write 10 sentences about..."
```

**4. Tasks Requiring Context from Each Other**
```
❌ Agents that need to "talk" to each other
✅ Single Claude instance that builds context as it works
```

### How Many Agents Should You Use?

**Many agents (5-20+):**
- Similar tasks (10 meeting notes)
- Independent work (no dependencies)
- Time-critical (need results fast)

**Few agents (2-4):**
- Different specializations (interviews vs surveys vs tickets)
- Resource-intensive tasks (deep analysis each)
- Complex synthesis required afterward

**One agent (just use Claude directly):**
- Single task
- Quick work
- Sequential dependencies

---

## 🔧 How Agents Work (Technical Overview for PMs)

### The Basics

**When you tell Claude to use agents, here's what happens:**

1. **Claude creates independent instances** - Each agent is a separate Claude execution
2. **Each agent gets its task** - Clear instructions and file access
3. **All agents work simultaneously** - True parallel processing
4. **Results combine** - Claude synthesizes agent outputs

### Agent Capabilities

Each agent has:
- ✅ Full file system access (can read/write files)
- ✅ All Claude's capabilities (analysis, writing, reasoning)
- ✅ Independent context (doesn't see other agents' work while running)
- ✅ Tool use (can create files, analyze data, etc.)

Each agent does NOT have:
- ❌ Communication with other agents (they work independently)
- ❌ Shared state (each has its own context)
- ❌ Knowledge of other agents' results (until synthesis)

### How to Prompt for Agents

**Pattern 1: Explicit agent request**
```
"Create 10 agents to process the 10 meeting notes in /meetings.
Each agent should extract:
- Key decisions
- Action items
- Blockers
- Next steps

Combine all results into @weekly-summary.md"
```

**Pattern 2: Let Claude decide**
```
"I have 15 competitor websites to research for features and pricing.
Work in parallel to get this done quickly."
```
Claude will intelligently spin up agents.

**Pattern 3: Specialized agents**
```
"Launch 3 specialized agents:
- Agent 1: Analyze all interview transcripts in /interviews
- Agent 2: Process survey data in @survey-results.csv
- Agent 3: Review support tickets in /support

Synthesize findings into @user-research-insights.md"
```

### Agent Output and Synthesis

**Agents create individual outputs:**
```
/meetings/
├── meeting-1-summary.md
├── meeting-2-summary.md
├── meeting-3-summary.md
...
└── meeting-10-summary.md
```

**Claude synthesizes into final deliverable:**
```
@weekly-summary.md
├── Executive Summary
├── Key Decisions (from all 10 meetings)
├── Action Items by Owner
├── Blockers and Risks
└── Recommendations
```

---

## 💼 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Meeting Processing Marathon

**Scenario:** It's Monday morning. You have 10 meeting recordings from last week. Your standup is in 1 hour. You need to know what happened, what's blocked, and what decisions were made.

**Without agents (50 minutes):**
- Listen to Meeting 1, take notes (5 min)
- Listen to Meeting 2, take notes (5 min)
- ... continue for all 10
- Manually combine into summary (10 min)
- Total: 60 minutes → You're late to standup

**With agents (5 minutes):**
```
"I have 10 meeting transcripts in /meetings/last-week/.

Create 10 agents to process each meeting simultaneously.

For each meeting, extract:
- Meeting name and date
- Key decisions made
- Action items (with owners and due dates)
- Blockers or risks raised
- Important context

Then synthesize ALL findings into @monday-standup-prep.md with:
- Section 1: Critical blockers needing immediate attention
- Section 2: Key decisions from last week
- Section 3: Action items by team member
- Section 4: Upcoming risks to watch

Format for easy skimming during standup."
```

**Result:**
- 5 minutes → Comprehensive synthesis ready
- You arrive at standup prepared
- You can lead effectively with full context

**Time saved: 55 minutes → Use it for strategic thinking instead**

### Example 2: Competitive Research Sprint

**Scenario:** Your CEO asks for competitive analysis on 5 competitors. She needs it by end of day for a board meeting. It's 2pm.

**Without agents (5 hours):**
- Research Competitor A: features, pricing, positioning (1 hour)
- Research Competitor B (1 hour)
- Research Competitor C (1 hour)
- Research Competitor D (1 hour)
- Research Competitor E (1 hour)
- Create comparison matrix (30 min)
- Total: 5.5 hours → You're working past midnight

**With agents (1 hour):**
```
"Launch 5 agents to research these competitors simultaneously:
- Company A: Asana
- Company B: Linear
- Company C: Monday.com
- Company D: ClickUp
- Company E: Notion

For each competitor, research and document:
- Product features and capabilities
- Pricing tiers and packaging
- Target market and positioning
- Recent product updates (last 6 months)
- User reviews and sentiment
- Key differentiators

Create individual files: @competitor-[name]-research.md

Then synthesize into @competitive-analysis.md with:
- Feature comparison matrix (table format)
- Pricing comparison (visualize tiers)
- Positioning map (how they position vs us)
- Gaps and opportunities (what we can do that they can't)
- Recommendations (where should TaskFlow focus?)
"
```

**Result:**
- 1 hour → Comprehensive competitive analysis
- CEO has what she needs for board meeting
- You look like a superstar

**Time saved: 4.5 hours → Attend your kid's soccer game instead**

### Example 3: Multi-Source User Research

**Scenario:** You're preparing for quarterly planning. You need to synthesize user research from 3 sources: interviews, surveys, and support tickets. Normally this takes a full day.

**Without agents (8 hours):**
- Read 20 interview transcripts (3 hours)
- Analyze survey data from 500 responses (2 hours)
- Review 100 support tickets (2 hours)
- Synthesize findings and identify patterns (1 hour)
- Total: 8 hours → Full day gone

**With agents (30 minutes):**
```
"Launch 3 specialized research agents to work in parallel:

Agent 1 - Interview Analyst:
- Read all files in /user-research/interviews/
- Identify top pain points mentioned
- Extract feature requests with frequency
- Find compelling user quotes
- Output: @interview-insights.md

Agent 2 - Survey Analyst:
- Analyze @survey-results.csv (500 responses)
- Calculate top pain points by percentage
- Segment findings by user role
- Identify statistical significance
- Output: @survey-insights.md

Agent 3 - Support Ticket Analyst:
- Review /support-tickets/q3/ folder (100 tickets)
- Categorize issues by theme
- Identify recurring problems
- Track severity and resolution time
- Output: @support-insights.md

After all agents complete, synthesize into @q4-user-research-synthesis.md:
- Top 5 pain points (cross-validated across all 3 sources)
- Feature requests ranked by demand
- User personas refined with real data
- Recommended focus areas for Q4
- Evidence for each recommendation (cite sources)
"
```

**Result:**
- 30 minutes → Complete user research synthesis
- Cross-validated insights from multiple sources
- Quantitative + qualitative evidence
- Ready for quarterly planning

**Time saved: 7.5 hours → Deep-dive into strategic implications**

### Example 4: Sprint Planning Preparation

**Scenario:** Sprint planning is tomorrow. You need to size the backlog (50 stories), check for dependencies, and identify risks. The team expects this analysis before the meeting.

**Without agents (4 hours):**
- Read each user story (2 hours)
- Size each story with reasoning (1.5 hours)
- Check dependencies manually (30 min)
- Total: 4 hours → Late night work

**With agents (20 minutes):**
```
"I have 50 user stories in /backlog/. Sprint planning is tomorrow.

Create multiple agents to analyze these stories in parallel.

For each story, determine:
- T-shirt size (XS, S, M, L, XL) with reasoning
- Technical complexity (1-10 scale)
- Dependencies on other stories
- Risks or unknowns
- Recommended sprint order

Then create @sprint-planning-prep.md with:
- Stories sorted by priority and dependencies
- Suggested 2-week sprint plan (we have 3 engineers = 30 person-days)
- Critical path visualization
- Risks requiring discussion
- Questions for the team
"
```

**Result:**
- 20 minutes → Complete sprint planning prep
- Team meeting is efficient and focused
- No surprises, clear sequencing

**Time saved: 3.5 hours → Prepare thoughtful questions for the team instead**

## 🎨 Agent Orchestration Patterns (Reusable Workflows)

### Pattern 1: Fan-Out Processing

**When to use:** Multiple similar tasks, need all results combined

**Structure:**
```
Main Claude
    │
    ├─ Agent 1 → Task 1 → Result 1
    ├─ Agent 2 → Task 2 → Result 2
    ├─ Agent 3 → Task 3 → Result 3
    └─ ...
    │
    └─ Synthesis → Combined Result
```

**Example prompt:**
```
"Process all 15 files in /meetings/ with 15 agents.
Extract action items from each.
Combine into single action item list grouped by owner."
```

### Pattern 2: Specialized Roles

**When to use:** Different types of analysis on different sources

**Structure:**
```
Main Claude
    │
    ├─ Specialist Agent 1 (Interviews) → Qualitative insights
    ├─ Specialist Agent 2 (Surveys) → Quantitative data
    └─ Specialist Agent 3 (Support) → Issue patterns
    │
    └─ Synthesis → Comprehensive Research Report
```

**Example prompt:**
```
"Launch 3 specialized agents:
- Agent 1 (Interview Expert): Analyze qualitative data
- Agent 2 (Data Analyst): Process survey numbers
- Agent 3 (Support Analyst): Categorize ticket themes

Synthesize into comprehensive user research report."
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel Research

**When to use:** Research multiple entities independently

**Structure:**
```
Main Claude
    │
    ├─ Agent 1 → Research Competitor A
    ├─ Agent 2 → Research Competitor B
    ├─ Agent 3 → Research Competitor C
    └─ ...
    │
    └─ Synthesis → Competitive Matrix
```

**Example prompt:**
```
"Research these 5 competitors in parallel.
Each agent creates detailed profile.
Synthesize into comparison matrix showing strengths/weaknesses."
```

### Pattern 4: Batch Document Generation

**When to use:** Create multiple similar documents

**Structure:**
```
Main Claude
    │
    ├─ Agent 1 → Create User Story 1
    ├─ Agent 2 → Create User Story 2
    ├─ Agent 3 → Create User Story 3
    └─ ...
    │
    └─ Quality Check → Validate consistency
```

**Example prompt:**
```
"From @prd.md, generate 20 user stories with acceptance criteria.
Use agents to create stories in parallel.
Ensure consistency in format and quality."
```

### Pattern 5: Validation Pipeline

**When to use:** Review multiple documents for quality

**Structure:**
```
Main Claude
    │
    ├─ Agent 1 → Review PRD 1 against checklist
    ├─ Agent 2 → Review PRD 2 against checklist
    ├─ Agent 3 → Review PRD 3 against checklist
    └─ ...
    │
    └─ Summary Report → Issues found + recommendations
```

**Example prompt:**
```
"Review all PRDs in /docs/prds/ against our quality checklist.
Each agent reviews one PRD.
Create summary report of issues and recommendations."
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### Do:

- ✅ **Use agents for time-sensitive batch work** - When you need results fast
- ✅ **Let Claude decide agent count** - "Process these files in parallel" works great
- ✅ **Provide clear individual task instructions** - Each agent needs to know what to do
- ✅ **Request synthesis** - Tell Claude to combine agent results meaningfully
- ✅ **Use agents for independent tasks** - No dependencies between tasks
- ✅ **Specify output format** - Tell agents how to structure their results
- ✅ **Trust the parallel execution** - Agents truly work simultaneously

### Don't:

- ❌ **Don't use agents for single tasks** - Just prompt Claude directly
- ❌ **Don't create agents that need to communicate** - They work independently
- ❌ **Don't use agents for sequential work** - Tasks with dependencies should be done in order
- ❌ **Don't over-agent small tasks** - If it takes 30 seconds, don't use agents
- ❌ **Don't forget synthesis** - Raw agent outputs need combining
- ❌ **Don't use agents when context matters** - If Task 2 needs Task 1's context, do sequentially

### Pro Tips:

1. **Experiment with agent counts** - Try different numbers to see what works best for your workflow

2. **Name your agents** - In specialized roles, give agents descriptive names:
   ```
   "Agent 1 (Interview Analyst): ..."
   "Agent 2 (Data Specialist): ..."
   ```

3. **Standardize output formats** - Make agent outputs consistent for easier synthesis:
   ```
   "Each agent should output markdown with these sections:
   - Summary
   - Key Findings
   - Recommendations"
   ```

4. **Use agents for experimentation** - Want to try 3 different PRD approaches? Use 3 agents:
   ```
   "Create 3 agents to write 3 different versions of this PRD:
   - Agent 1: Technical-focused approach
   - Agent 2: User benefit-focused approach
   - Agent 3: Business value-focused approach

   Let me compare and choose the best."
   ```

5. **Combine with other features** - Agents + @ file references + output styles = powerful workflows

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "The agents aren't working in parallel"

**Likely cause:** The prompt wasn't explicit about parallelization

**Fix:**
- Say explicitly: "Create agents to work in parallel" or "Simultaneously process"
- Use phrases like "at the same time" or "all at once"
- Let Claude know this is time-sensitive

### "Agent results are inconsistent in format"

**Likely cause:** Insufficient output format instructions

**Fix:**
Provide clear template for each agent:
```
"Each agent should output markdown file with exactly these sections:
## Summary
[1 paragraph overview]

## Key Findings
- Finding 1
- Finding 2
- Finding 3

## Recommendations
[Specific next steps]"
```

### "Too many agents were created"

**Likely cause:** Unclear scope or Claude being over-eager

**Fix:**
- Specify exact count: "Create exactly 5 agents"
- Or provide constraint: "Use as many agents as needed, max 10"

### "Agents finished but no synthesis"

**Likely cause:** Forgot to request synthesis in prompt

**Fix:**
Always end agent requests with synthesis instruction:
```
"After all agents complete, synthesize results into @summary.md"
```

### "One agent failed, whole process stopped"

**Likely cause:** Agent encountered error (missing file, unclear instruction)

**Fix:**
- Check agent error message for specific issue
- Ensure all referenced files exist
- Verify instructions are clear
- Re-run with corrected prompt

### "Don't know if agents are still working"

**Likely cause:** Long-running agent process

**What to do:**
- Claude will show progress indicators
- Be patient - complex agent work takes time
- You can check files in Obsidian to see results appearing

## 🎉 You've Unlocked the Superpower!

Agents are what make Claude Code fundamentally different from regular chatbots. You're not just getting faster responses - you're getting the ability to multiply yourself.

**Remember:**
- 10 tasks × 5 minutes each = 50 minutes sequential
- 10 agents × 5 minutes = 5 minutes parallel
- **That's not 10% better. That's 10x better.**

Now go forth and parallelize your PM work! 🚀
