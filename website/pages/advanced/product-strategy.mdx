## Reference Guide

**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025
**Time to Complete:** 60-90 minutes (interactive module)
**Prerequisites:**
- Module 1.4 (Task Orchestration - for parallel competitive research)
- Module 1.5 (Custom Sub-Agents - understanding agent capabilities)
- Familiarity with strategic thinking concepts

---

## 📖 Overview

This module teaches you how to develop product strategy using AI as a thinking partner - not to generate strategy for you, but to help you think more rigorously about strategic choices. You'll learn to use Rumelt's Strategy Kernel framework (Diagnosis → Guiding Policy → Coherent Actions) to structure your strategic thinking, pressure-test choices with devil's advocate, and transform strategy documents into executive presentations.

**Key takeaway:** Product strategy is about making hard choices on WHERE to compete and HOW to win - AI can't make those decisions for you, but it can help you research faster, apply frameworks rigorously, challenge your assumptions, and communicate clearly.

---

## 🎯 What is Product Strategy?

### The Core Concept

Product strategy isn't a feature list or a vision statement - it's a set of **hard choices** about where to focus resources and how to create competitive advantage. Good strategy requires:

1. **Making tradeoffs** - Saying YES to some opportunities and NO to others
2. **Focused resources** - Concentrating efforts rather than spreading thin
3. **Clear positioning** - Defining how you're different from competitors
4. **Coherent actions** - Ensuring initiatives reinforce each other

### What Strategy Is NOT

❌ **Goals masquerading as strategy:** "We'll increase revenue 50%" (that's a goal, not a strategy)
❌ **Feature lists:** "We'll build AI chat, voice, and automation" (that's a roadmap, not a strategy)
❌ **Vision statements:** "We'll be the best productivity tool" (that's aspiration, not strategy)
✅ **Real strategy:** "We'll focus exclusively on voice-first AI for SMBs, explicitly NOT competing on breadth against Notion" (clear choices, tradeoffs, positioning)

### Why AI Can't Do Strategy Alone

Strategy requires:
- **Context** - Deep understanding of your market, team, constraints (AI doesn't have this)
- **Judgment** - Deciding what tradeoffs are worth making (requires human intuition)
- **Commitment** - Willingness to say no and live with consequences (AI can't commit)

What AI CAN do:
- **Research faster** - Competitive landscape analysis in minutes vs. hours
- **Apply frameworks rigorously** - Structure thinking systematically
- **Challenge assumptions** - Play devil's advocate to stress-test choices
- **Synthesize documents** - Turn strategic choices into polished strategy docs
- **Create presentations** - Transform written strategy into executive slides

## 🧠 Rumelt's Strategy Kernel Framework

### The Three-Part Structure

Richard Rumelt's "Strategy Kernel" from *Good Strategy, Bad Strategy* provides the foundation for strategic thinking:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         1. DIAGNOSIS                    │
│    What's the challenge/opportunity?    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       2. GUIDING POLICY                 │
│   What's our overall approach?          │
│   (WHERE to compete, HOW to win)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│      3. COHERENT ACTIONS                │
│   What specific steps will we take?     │
│   (Initiatives that reinforce each      │
│    other and align with the policy)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. Diagnosis - Understanding the Challenge

**What it is:** A clear, actionable statement of the strategic challenge or opportunity you're facing.

**Good diagnosis:**
- Based on real data (competitive research, user feedback, market trends)
- Cuts through complexity to the essential issue
- Identifies the critical constraint or opportunity
- Frames the problem in a way that suggests action

**Example:**
> "The AI landscape is heating up fast. Notion, Linear, and Asana have all launched AI features in the past 6 months. As a smaller player with a 2-person AI team and limited budget (~$50k/quarter), we can't compete on breadth. We need to find a defensible position where we can uniquely win with limited resources."

**Not a good diagnosis:**
> "Competitors are doing AI" (too vague, no insight)

### 2. Guiding Policy - Your Strategic Approach

**What it is:** Your overall approach to dealing with the diagnosis. This is where you make **hard choices** about where to compete and how to win.

**Good guiding policy:**
- Makes explicit tradeoffs (says YES to some things, NO to others)
- Creates focus by choosing a specific direction
- Defines competitive positioning (how you're different)
- Acts as a filter for future decisions

**Example:**
> "We'll focus exclusively on voice-first AI for SMBs (5-20 person teams), explicitly NOT competing on breadth against larger players. We'll differentiate through AI features that small teams need but enterprise-focused competitors won't build. We'll subsidize AI costs in our base pricing to drive adoption, accepting lower margins initially to build defensibility through usage data and retention."

**Not a good guiding policy:**
> "We'll build great AI features and win in the market" (no choices, no tradeoffs)

### 3. Coherent Actions - Your Roadmap

**What it is:** Specific, coordinated initiatives that implement your guiding policy. These actions should reinforce each other and create momentum.

**Good coherent actions:**
- Align directly with the guiding policy
- Reinforce each other (not scattered, random initiatives)
- Sequenced logically (dependencies considered)
- Resource-focused (concentrated effort, not spread thin)

**Example:**
> **Q1 2026:**
> - Expand voice to meeting notes + task breakdown (deepening voice capability)
> - Launch SMB-specific templates (5-20 person team workflows)
> - A/B test AI in base price vs. premium tier
>
> **Q2 2026:**
> - Voice collaboration features (multi-user voice sessions)
> - SMB admin dashboard (usage tracking for small team leads)
> - Refine pricing based on Q1 data

**Not coherent actions:**
> Random list of features with no connection to each other or the strategy

## 🔬 Using AI for Product Strategy

### The Strategy Development Workflow

```
1. COMPETITIVE RESEARCH
   ↓ (Use parallel agents with WebSearch)

2. STRATEGIC CHOICES
   ↓ (Make 5 key tradeoff decisions)

3. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE
   ↓ (Pressure-test each choice)

4. SYNTHESIS
   ↓ (AI creates strategy doc using Rumelt's Kernel)

5. PRESENTATION
   ↓ (Use pptx skill for executive slides)
```

### 1. Competitive Research with Parallel Agents

**The approach:**
Instead of sequentially researching competitors, launch multiple agents in parallel to research different competitors simultaneously.

**How to do it:**

```markdown
Spin up 3 agents to research the competitive AI landscape:
- Agent 1: Research Notion's AI features, pricing, and positioning
- Agent 2: Research Linear's AI features, pricing, and positioning
- Agent 3: Research Asana's AI features, pricing, and positioning

For each competitor, I need:
- What AI features they've launched
- How they position and price AI
- What seems to be working vs. not working
- Where there might be whitespace for us
```

**Why parallel agents work:**
- 3x faster than sequential research (3 agents = 3x speed)
- Each agent uses WebSearch for latest information
- Results consolidated into competitive insights

**Output:** Competitive landscape summary that informs your Diagnosis

### 2. Making Strategic Choices

Instead of trying to invent strategy from scratch, answer 5 multiple-choice questions that force real tradeoffs:

**Choice #1 - FOCUS VS BREADTH**
- A) Go deep on one capability (e.g., voice-first)
- B) Spread AI across all features (broad but shallow)
- C) Partner for capabilities, focus on integration

**Choice #2 - COMPETITIVE RESPONSE**
- A) Race to out-innovate (match features quickly)
- B) Differentiate differently (compete where you can win)
- C) Ignore and focus (stick to your roadmap)

**Choice #3 - BUSINESS MODEL**
- A) Premium AI tier (margins over adoption)
- B) Subsidize to drive adoption (growth over margins)
- C) Usage-based pricing (align costs with value)

**Choice #4 - PRODUCT SCOPE**
- A) AI as the product (rebuild AI-first)
- B) AI as enhancement (AI makes existing features better)
- C) AI for specific jobs (focused use cases)

**Choice #5 - RISK TOLERANCE**
- A) Move fast, take risks (speed over polish)
- B) Deliberate and defensible (quality over speed)
- C) Wait and learn (fast follower strategy)

Each choice shapes a different aspect of your strategy. Your 5 answers become your Guiding Policy.

### 3. Devil's Advocate - Pressure-Testing Choices

After each choice, use AI to challenge your thinking:

**How it works:**

```markdown
User chooses: "A) Go deep on voice"

Devil's advocate response:
"You're betting everything on voice. But what if voice becomes
commoditized in 6 months? OpenAI just released better voice
recognition at 1/10th the cost. If everyone has voice, you've
built your strategy on something that's no longer differentiated.
With a 2-person team, you won't have resources to pivot.
Isn't this risky?"

User then: Stick with choice OR Reconsider
```

**Why this works:**
- Forces you to think through downsides BEFORE committing
- Surfaces risks you might have overlooked
- Stress-tests your conviction (if you can't defend it, maybe it's wrong)
- Better to hear hard questions from AI than from your CEO

**Pro tip:** The devil's advocate isn't trying to change your mind - it's helping you refine your thinking.

### 4. Synthesizing Strategy Documents

Once you've made your 5 strategic choices, AI can synthesize them into a complete strategy document using Rumelt's Kernel:

**What AI does:**
- Takes competitive research → Diagnosis
- Takes your 5 choices → Guiding Policy
- Creates 6-month roadmap aligned with choices → Coherent Actions
- Adds critical assumptions, risks, positioning

**What YOU provide:**
- The strategic choices (AI can't make these for you)
- Context about your constraints and situation
- Judgment about which devil's advocate challenges matter

**Example output structure:**

```markdown
# H1 2026 AI Product Strategy

## DIAGNOSIS: The Strategic Challenge
[Competitive landscape + your constraints → core challenge]

## GUIDING POLICY: Our Strategic Approach
[Your 5 choices synthesized into coherent direction]
[Explicit tradeoffs - what we're NOT doing]

## COHERENT ACTIONS: H1 2026 Roadmap

### Q1 2026
- Initiative 1 (aligned with choices)
- Initiative 2 (aligned with choices)
- Initiative 3 (aligned with choices)

### Q2 2026
- Initiative 4 (builds on Q1)
- Initiative 5 (builds on Q1)

### Success Metrics
- Metric 1: [Target]
- Metric 2: [Target]

## CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS
- Assumption 1: [What needs to be true]
- Assumption 2: [How we'll validate]

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
- Why customers choose us vs. alternatives
- Our defensible advantages
- Risks and mitigation
```

### 5. Creating Executive Presentations with Skills

Transform your strategy document into presentation slides using the pptx skill:

**How to use:**

```markdown
Use the pptx skill to create an executive presentation from
my strategy document.

Requirements:
- 12-15 slides covering complete strategy
- Include: Title, Executive Summary, Diagnosis, Competitive
  Landscape, Strategic Direction, Tradeoffs, Roadmap (Q1/Q2),
  Success Metrics, Critical Assumptions, Why We'll Win, Risks
- Professional design for executive audience
- Save as strategy-review-slides.pptx
```

**What the skill generates:**
- Title slide with strategy title and date
- Executive summary (1-2 slides for time-pressed execs)
- Diagnosis slide (the strategic challenge)
- Competitive landscape (table or matrix)
- Strategic direction (your guiding policy)
- Explicit tradeoffs (what you're NOT doing)
- Roadmap slides (Q1 and Q2 initiatives)
- Success metrics (how you'll measure)
- Critical assumptions (what needs to be true)
- Competitive positioning (why you'll win)
- Risks and mitigation
- The ask (what you need from leadership)

**Pro tip:** The pptx skill requires `python-pptx` library. If installation fails, you can create a markdown outline of slides instead - the learning (using skills to transform documents) is still achieved.

## 💼 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Expanding AI Capabilities at TaskFlow

**Scenario:** You're the Gen AI PM at TaskFlow. You shipped AI voice chat for todos (well-received, moderate usage) and improved activation with guided onboarding (45% → 56% for small teams). Leadership asks: "How should we evolve our AI strategy for H1 2026?"

**How to approach:**

**Step 1 - Research competitors:**
```markdown
Spin up 3 agents to research:
- Notion AI (how they position, what features, pricing)
- Linear AI (engineering-focused features, adoption signals)
- Asana AI (enterprise focus, strategic direction)

Each agent uses WebSearch for latest info, returns summary.
```

**Step 2 - Identify diagnosis:**
Based on competitive research + your constraints:
- Everyone's adding AI, no clear winner yet
- You have a 2-person AI team, ~$50k/quarter budget
- Can build ~1 major AI feature per quarter
- TaskFlow targets SMBs (5-20 person teams)

**Diagnosis:** "We can't compete on breadth with limited resources. Need to find defensible position where we uniquely win."

**Step 3 - Make strategic choices:**
- Choice #1: Go deep on voice (focus beats spread)
- Choice #2: Differentiate for SMBs (compete where we can win)
- Choice #3: Subsidize AI costs (drive adoption over margins initially)
- Choice #4: AI as enhancement (not rebuilding product)
- Choice #5: Deliberate and defensible (quality over speed)

**Step 4 - Devil's advocate each choice:**
After each choice, hear the challenge:
- "What if voice gets commoditized?"
- "Is SMB really different from enterprise?"
- "Can you afford to subsidize costs?"
- etc.

Refine or stick with each choice.

**Step 5 - Synthesize strategy:**
AI creates complete strategy doc:
- Diagnosis from research
- Guiding policy from your 5 choices
- Coherent actions as H1 2026 roadmap

**Step 6 - Create slides:**
Use pptx skill to generate 13-slide executive deck.

**Outcome:** Complete, defensible AI strategy ready to pitch to leadership.

### Example 2: Competitive Response Strategy

**Scenario:** A major competitor (Notion) just launched AI features similar to yours and is marketing heavily. Your CEO asks: "How should we respond?"

**How to approach:**

**Option A - Use the strategic choice framework:**

Ask yourself Choice #2: Competitive Response
- A) Race to out-innovate (risky, resource-intensive)
- B) Differentiate differently (compete on different axis)
- C) Ignore and focus (stick to plan)

**Devil's advocate for each:**
- If A: "Can you really out-innovate a well-funded competitor? They have 10x your team."
- If B: "What's truly differentiated? SMBs use same tools as enterprise."
- If C: "Ignoring competition = losing customers to Notion's marketing."

**Option B - Use competitive research:**

```markdown
Research Notion's AI launch:
- What features did they ship?
- How are they pricing it?
- What's the early feedback from users?
- Where are the gaps in their offering?

Then identify whitespace: What can you do that Notion WON'T do?
```

**Option C - Update your guiding policy:**

If Notion's launch changes the landscape, revisit your guiding policy:
- Does our strategy still work in this new context?
- What assumptions did we make that are now invalid?
- Do we need to adjust our positioning?

**Outcome:** Data-driven response vs. reactive panic.

### Example 3: Quarterly Strategy Review

**Scenario:** It's Q2. Your H1 2026 strategy assumed AI costs would stay flat, but they've increased 40%. Your CFO wants to know: "Do we need to change the strategy?"

**How to approach:**

**Step 1 - Revisit critical assumptions:**
Open your strategy doc, review "Critical Assumptions" section:
- Assumption: AI costs remain ~$3/user/month
- Reality: Now $4.20/user/month (40% increase)
- Impact: Subsidizing AI is eating into margins faster than expected

**Step 2 - Evaluate guiding policy:**
Does the 40% cost increase break your guiding policy?
- Choice #3 was: "Subsidize AI costs to drive adoption"
- Is this still viable? Or do you need to reconsider pricing?

**Step 3 - Devil's advocate:**
Challenge the assumption:
```markdown
"The strategy assumed we could subsidize costs short-term to
build defensibility. But costs increased 40% faster than expected.
If we continue subsidizing, we'll burn through cash in 6 months.
Should we pivot to premium AI tier to protect margins?"
```

**Step 4 - Update coherent actions:**
If guiding policy still holds, adjust tactics:
- Negotiate better AI infrastructure pricing
- Optimize usage (reduce unnecessary API calls)
- Consider usage-based pricing for heavy users
- Accelerate retention initiatives (higher LTV justifies higher CAC)

If guiding policy needs changing:
- Pivot to premium AI tier (Choice #3 → A instead of B)
- Update roadmap to align with new pricing
- Communicate change to team and customers

**Outcome:** Strategic adaptability without panic-driven changes.

## 💡 Best Practices

### Do:

✅ **Base diagnosis on real data** - Use competitive research, user feedback, market trends (not gut feeling)

✅ **Make explicit tradeoffs** - Say what you're NOT doing (real strategy requires saying no)

✅ **Use devil's advocate rigorously** - Pressure-test every choice before committing

✅ **Ensure coherent actions** - Roadmap initiatives should reinforce each other, not scatter

✅ **Document assumptions** - Write down what needs to be true for the strategy to work

✅ **Review quarterly** - Strategy should be stable but not static; adjust based on learning

✅ **Communicate clearly** - Use executive presentations to align stakeholders

### Don't:

❌ **Let AI make strategic decisions** - AI can't make tradeoffs or commit; that's your job

❌ **Confuse goals with strategy** - "Increase revenue 50%" is a goal, not a strategy

❌ **Create feature lists instead of strategy** - Listing what you'll build isn't strategic

❌ **Skip the hard tradeoffs** - Real strategy requires saying NO to good opportunities

❌ **Ignore competitive landscape** - Your strategy exists in competitive context

❌ **Set and forget** - Strategy needs periodic review as assumptions get validated/invalidated

❌ **Make strategy in a vacuum** - Involve team, pressure-test with stakeholders

### Pro Tips:

1. **Use the 5 strategic choice questions** - Easier than inventing strategy from scratch, forces real tradeoffs

2. **Parallel agents for competitive research** - 3 competitors researched simultaneously = 3x faster than sequential

3. **Devil's advocate after EVERY choice** - Don't skip this; it surfaces risks before you commit

4. **Synthesize with Rumelt's Kernel** - Forces structured thinking (diagnosis → policy → actions)

5. **Create executive slides** - Strategy isn't real until it's communicated; slides force clarity

6. **Document what you're NOT doing** - Explicit tradeoffs help future decision-making

7. **Review assumptions quarterly** - When assumptions break, update tactics (or strategy if needed)

8. **Show your work** - Include competitive research, devil's advocate challenges, tradeoffs in final doc

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "My strategy feels generic - could apply to any company"

**Likely cause:** Not making specific enough choices. Generic strategy = no tradeoffs.

**Fix:**
1. Review your guiding policy - does it say what you're NOT doing?
2. Add explicit tradeoffs: "We'll do X, explicitly NOT Y"
3. Include specific constraints: "With our 2-person team and $50k budget..."
4. Test: Could a competitor copy this word-for-word? If yes, it's too generic.

**Example:**
- ❌ Generic: "We'll build great AI features to win in the market"
- ✅ Specific: "We'll focus exclusively on voice-first AI for SMBs, explicitly NOT competing on breadth against Notion, subsidizing costs initially to build defensibility through retention data"

### "Devil's advocate questions feel unfair/overly negative"

**Likely cause:** Devil's advocate is doing its job - surfacing uncomfortable truths.

**Fix:**
1. Remember: Better to hear hard questions from AI than from your CEO
2. If you can't defend your choice against the challenge, maybe reconsider
3. Devil's advocate isn't trying to change your mind - it's stress-testing your conviction
4. Use challenges to refine your thinking, not abandon good ideas

**Pro tip:** If the devil's advocate challenge reveals a real risk, add it to "Critical Assumptions" section with mitigation plan.

### "Competitive research is outdated by the time I finish"

**Likely cause:** AI landscape moves fast; yesterday's research might be outdated tomorrow.

**Fix:**
1. Use parallel agents with WebSearch for latest info (not static data)
2. Focus on competitive positioning and patterns (not just feature lists)
3. Include "Last researched" dates in strategy doc
4. Review competitive landscape quarterly, not just once
5. Monitor competitor launches via newsletters, Reddit, product hunt

**Pro tip:** Follow competitors' product blogs, changelog pages, and Twitter accounts for real-time updates.

### "pptx skill won't install / python-pptx errors"

**Likely cause:** Missing Python dependencies or environment issues.

**Fix:**
1. First attempt: `pip install python-pptx`
2. If that fails: `pip3 install python-pptx`
3. Check Python version: `python --version` (needs 3.7+)
4. If still failing after 2-3 attempts, use graceful fallback:
   - Create markdown outline of slides instead
   - Structure it as: Slide 1: Title, Slide 2: Executive Summary, etc.
   - Frame positively: "Dependencies can be tricky - in real PM work, you'd work with engineering to solve this. The key learning (using skills for document transformation) is still achieved!"

**Remember:** The goal is learning about skills, not debugging Python.

### "My 5 strategic choices contradict each other"

**Likely cause:** Choices made in isolation without considering how they fit together.

**Fix:**
1. Review all 5 choices together - do they tell a coherent story?
2. Check for contradictions:
   - Can't be "deep focus" (Choice #1) AND "spread everywhere"
   - Can't be "deliberate/quality" (Choice #5) AND "move fast/risky"
3. If choices contradict, revisit devil's advocate challenges
4. Test coherence: Could you explain all 5 choices in one paragraph that makes sense?

**Example of coherent choices:**
- Focus: Go deep on voice (not breadth)
- Competition: Differentiate for SMBs
- Pricing: Subsidize to drive adoption
- Scope: AI as enhancement (not rebuilding)
- Risk: Deliberate and defensible

These fit together: Deep focus on voice for SMBs, subsidized to drive adoption, enhancing existing product, quality over speed.

### "Strategy document is too long - executives won't read it"

**Likely cause:** Including too much detail in the main strategy doc.

**Fix:**
1. Create executive summary (1-2 paragraphs) at the top
2. Use the slide deck for executive communication (13 slides vs. 10-page doc)
3. Structure doc with clear sections: Diagnosis (2-3 paragraphs), Guiding Policy (3-5 bullets), Coherent Actions (simple roadmap)
4. Move detailed research to appendix
5. Use bullet points and bold text for scannability

**Rule of thumb:** Main strategy section should fit on 2 pages. Details go in appendix.
