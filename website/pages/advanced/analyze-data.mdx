## Reference Guide

**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025
**Time to Complete:** 60-75 minutes (interactive module)
**Prerequisites:** Module 2.1 (Writing PRDs), basic understanding of CSV files and product metrics

---

## 📖 Overview

This module teaches the complete PM workflow for data-driven feature development: discovering problems through data analysis, estimating business impact before building, and analyzing experiment results to make ship/kill decisions. You'll learn to use Claude Code as your data analysis partner, processing CSV files from analytics tools, building ROI models, and running statistical analyses on A/B tests.

**Key takeaway:** Never stop at topline metrics—always segment by your target customer, check quality over quantity, and look for leading indicators that predict long-term success.

---

## 🎯 The Three-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery - Find Problems with Data

Use quantitative and qualitative data to identify WHERE users are dropping off and WHY.

**What you'll do:**
- Analyze funnel data (CSV exports from Mixpanel, Amplitude, etc.)
- Process survey responses to understand user pain points
- Cross-reference quantitative drop-offs with qualitative feedback
- Synthesize findings into a problem analysis document

**Example scenario:** Your activation rate is stuck at 45% for 6 months. Leadership wants answers. Instead of guessing, you analyze the funnel and discover 60% of users drop between "create task" and "complete task." Survey data reveals they're overwhelmed by the blank canvas and need examples.

**Deliverable:** `problem-analysis.md` documenting the problem, supporting evidence, and proposed solution.

---

### Phase 2: Impact Estimation - Is It Worth Building?

Build ROI models to justify engineering investment before writing a single line of code.

**The framework:**
```
Impact = Users Affected × Current Action Rate × Expected Lift × Value per Action
```

**What you'll do:**
- Calculate baseline metrics from usage data
- Estimate lift based on user research, competitor benchmarks, and historical data
- Model business impact (revenue, activation, retention)
- Create three scenarios (pessimistic/realistic/optimistic) to acknowledge uncertainty
- Calculate ROI over 1 year and 3 years

**Example scenario:** Your proposed Guided Onboarding feature will cost $100k (4 eng-months). You estimate it will improve activation from 45% → 58% for 70% of users, generating $39k ARR in year 1 and $943k in LTV over 3 years. ROI: 9.4x over 3 years.

**Deliverables:**
- `impact-estimate.md` with baseline, projections, and business impact
- `roi-scenarios.md` with pessimistic/realistic/optimistic cases

---

### Phase 3: Experiment Analysis - Did It Work?

Analyze A/B test results beyond topline metrics to find the real story.

**What you'll do:**
- Calculate topline activation rates (treatment vs control)
- Run statistical significance tests (p-values, confidence intervals)
- Segment by customer type (small teams vs enterprise)
- Check quality metrics (retention, engagement, not just quantity)
- Analyze leading indicators (feature adoption, viral metrics)
- Write experiment readout with ship/iterate/kill recommendation

**Example scenario:** Your topline shows only 45% → 48% activation (+2.6pp, barely significant). Looks disappointing! But segmentation reveals +11.4pp for small teams (huge win!) and -3.5pp for enterprise (negative effect). Quality metrics show 78% vs 60% retention among activated users. Recommendation: Ship to small teams, exclude enterprise.

**Deliverable:** `experiment-readout.md` with executive summary, segment analysis, quality metrics, and clear recommendation.

## 📊 The Impact Estimation Framework

### The Formula

```
Impact = Users Affected × Current Action Rate × Expected Lift × Value per Action
```

### Component Breakdown

**1. Users Affected**
- How many users will see this feature?
- Account for gradual rollout (not always 100%)
- Consider segment targeting (e.g., only small teams)

**Example:** 5,000 signups/month × 70% see guided onboarding = 3,500 users affected

**2. Current Action Rate**
- What % currently take the desired action?
- Get from analytics tool (Mixpanel, Amplitude)

**Example:** 45% activation rate (2,025/4,500 complete first task)

**3. Expected Lift**
- How much will the feature improve the rate?
- **This is the hardest part!** Sources:
  - Similar features you've shipped
  - Competitor benchmarks
  - User research (60% drop due to X, fix X → recover 50% of that)
  - Expert judgment from eng/design/PM

**Example:** Survey shows 60% drop due to "need examples." Fix that, conservatively recover 30% of drop → estimate 13pp lift (45% → 58%)

**4. Value per Action**
- What's each incremental action worth?
- For activation: LTV × conversion rate
- For retention: extended LTV
- For viral: invite acceptance × activation × conversion × LTV

**Example:** Activated user → 60% convert × $12/mo × 24 months = $172.80 LTV per activation

### Three-Scenario Approach

**Always model uncertainty:**

**Pessimistic (20th percentile):**
- Lower adoption (30% vs 70%)
- Smaller lift (45% → 50% vs 58%)
- Minimum expected impact

**Realistic (50th percentile):**
- Expected adoption (70%)
- Conservative lift estimate (45% → 58%)
- Most likely case

**Optimistic (80th percentile):**
- High adoption (90%)
- Strong lift plus secondary effects (45% → 62% + retention boost)
- Best case scenario

**Present all three to leadership** so they understand the range of outcomes and can make informed bets.

## 🔬 Experiment Analysis Best Practices

### Never Stop at Topline Metrics

**The trap:** You run an A/B test. Topline shows modest results (45% → 48%, p=0.04). You consider killing it.

**The mistake:** You haven't segmented yet!

**The lesson:** Topline metrics can hide segment wins. Always segment by your target customer before making decisions.

### Always Segment by Target Customer

**Why it matters:**
- Features often work differently for different user types
- Your target market (e.g., small teams) might see huge wins
- Non-target segments (e.g., enterprise) might have negative effects
- Topline averages these out, masking the truth

**How to do it:**
```
"Segment the experiment results by company_size and calculate activation rates for each segment"
```

Claude will break down results by segment and show you where the feature really works.

### Check Quality Over Quantity

**Activation rate tells you HOW MANY users activated.**

**Retention tells you if those are GOOD activations.**

**Always check:**
- Week 1 retention among activated users
- Engagement metrics (tasks completed, features used)
- Long-term retention (30-day, 60-day)

**Why:** You want better users, not just more users. 78% retention with 48% activation is way better than 60% retention with 50% activation.

### Look for Leading Indicators

**Leading indicators predict future success:**

- **Feature adoption:** Do users engage with the new feature?
- **Viral metrics:** Do users invite teammates?
- **Template usage:** Do users adopt productivity shortcuts?
- **Depth of engagement:** Do users use advanced features?

**Example:** Invite rate 35% vs 12% means 2.9x more viral growth, predicting higher LTV and lower CAC.

### Statistical Significance Matters

**p < 0.05:** Statistically significant (less than 5% chance this is random noise)

**p > 0.05:** Not statistically significant (could be random)

**Confidence intervals:** Show the range of plausible effect sizes

**Example:**
- Lift: +2.6pp
- p-value: 0.04 (barely significant)
- 95% CI: [0.1%, 5.1%] (wide range - could be small or moderate)

**Interpretation:** Barely significant with wide uncertainty → dig deeper before deciding!

## 💡 Real-World PM Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Stuck Activation Rate

**Situation:** Your activation has plateaued at 45% for 6 months. Leadership is asking what you're doing about it.

**How Claude Code helps:**
1. **Analyze funnel data:** "Read activation-funnel-q4.csv and find the biggest drop-off"
2. **Process surveys:** "Analyze user-survey-responses.csv and extract top complaints"
3. **Cross-reference:** "The 60% drop-off at 'task completion' correlates with survey feedback about 'need examples'"
4. **Synthesize:** "Create a problem analysis document with quantitative and qualitative evidence"

**Outcome:** Clear problem statement backed by data, proposed solution, and stakeholder alignment document ready to share.

---

### Scenario 2: Justifying a Major Feature

**Situation:** You want to build Guided Onboarding ($100k, 4 eng-months). Engineering is skeptical, leadership wants ROI projections.

**How Claude Code helps:**
1. **Show framework:** "Read impact-estimation-framework.md and explain the formula"
2. **Calculate baseline:** "Analyze taskflow-usage-data-q4.csv to calculate current activation rate and time-to-value"
3. **Estimate lift:** "Based on the survey data showing 60% need examples, estimate conservative lift"
4. **Model impact:** "Build complete ROI model with baseline, projections, and business impact"
5. **Create scenarios:** "Generate pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic scenarios"

**Outcome:** Comprehensive impact estimate showing 9.4x ROI over 3 years, with scenario analysis showing even pessimistic case returns 2.6x. Engineering and leadership approve the build.

---

### Scenario 3: Analyzing Experiment Results

**Situation:** Your Guided Onboarding experiment finished. Topline shows only 45% → 48% (+2.6pp). Team is disappointed and considering killing it.

**How Claude Code helps:**
1. **Check topline:** "Calculate overall activation rates for control and treatment"
2. **Segment:** "Segment results by company_size - what do small teams show?"
3. **Quality metrics:** "Among activated users, calculate week 1 retention for both cohorts"
4. **Leading indicators:** "Compare template usage and invite rates between cohorts"
5. **Synthesize:** "Create experiment readout with recommendation"

**Outcome:** Segmentation reveals +11.4pp for small teams (your target!), retention jumps 60% → 78%, template usage 3.2x higher. Clear recommendation: Ship to small teams, exclude enterprise. What looked like a failure is actually a huge win.

## 📁 Working with CSV Data Files

### Data Sources PMs Use

**Analytics platforms:**
- Mixpanel, Amplitude → Export usage events, funnels
- Optimizely, LaunchDarkly → Export A/B test results
- Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey → Export survey responses
- Google Analytics → Export traffic/conversion data

**File formats:**
- CSV (most common)
- TSV (tab-separated values)
- JSON (from APIs)

**Claude Code can read all of these directly!**

### Viewing CSV Files

**Note:** CSV files won't render nicely in Obsidian (they're not markdown).

**Options for viewing:**
- **Excel or Google Sheets:** Best for exploring data visually
- **VS Code:** Good for viewing raw structure
- **Numbers (Mac):** Native Mac spreadsheet app
- **Let Claude read it:** Claude will format data in clean markdown tables for you

**Recommended approach:** Let Claude read and analyze the CSV, presenting results in formatted tables. View raw CSV only if you need to verify specific data points.

### Sample CSV Structure

**activation-funnel-q4.csv:**
```csv
step,users_entered,users_completed,completion_rate,median_time_to_complete
Signup,10000,10000,1.0,0
First Task Created,10000,7200,0.72,18
First Task Completed,7200,2880,0.40,45
Invite Sent,2880,1440,0.50,24
```

**onboarding-experiment-results.csv:**
```csv
user_id,cohort,company_size,completed_first_task,invited_teammate,tasks_completed_week_1
control_user_0001,control,5-20,True,False,4
control_user_0002,control,5-20,False,False,0
treatment_user_0001,treatment,5-20,True,True,8
```

Claude reads these and presents them as:

| Step | Users Entered | Completion Rate | Drop-off |
|------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Signup | 10,000 | 100% | - |
| First Task Created | 7,200 | 72% | 28% |
| First Task Completed | 2,880 | 40% | 60% ← Biggest drop |

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Do:

- ✅ **Always validate hypotheses with data** - Don't guess, analyze
- ✅ **Create three scenarios for every estimate** - Acknowledge uncertainty
- ✅ **Segment by target customer** - Topline can hide segment wins
- ✅ **Check quality metrics** - Retention matters more than activation count
- ✅ **Look for leading indicators** - Predict long-term success early
- ✅ **Document your assumptions** - Make impact estimates transparent
- ✅ **Cross-reference quant + qual data** - Funnel + surveys tell full story
- ✅ **Present full experiment context** - Not just "it worked" but WHY and FOR WHOM

### Don't:

- ❌ **Don't stop at topline metrics** - Always dig deeper with segmentation
- ❌ **Don't use single-point estimates** - Use ranges and scenarios
- ❌ **Don't assume 100% adoption** - Account for gradual rollout
- ❌ **Don't ignore negative segments** - If enterprise performs poorly, exclude them
- ❌ **Don't kill experiments too early** - Check segments and quality first
- ❌ **Don't forget statistical significance** - p-values and confidence intervals matter
- ❌ **Don't over-optimize lift estimates** - Be conservative, under-promise
- ❌ **Don't skip the "why"** - Always explain the reasoning behind numbers

### Pro Tips:

1. **Use historical data when available** - Your past experiments are the best predictor of future lift, not competitor benchmarks

2. **Front-load the disappointing news** - When presenting experiment results, show the modest topline first, then reveal the segment wins. This teaches stakeholders to always dig deeper.

3. **Build a lift estimate library** - Track every feature's estimated vs actual lift. After 5-10 features, you'll get much better at estimating.

4. **Automate your analysis scripts** - Save the prompts you use for funnel analysis, segmentation, and ROI modeling. Reuse them across features.

5. **Show your work** - When presenting impact estimates, include the full calculation breakdown. Transparency builds trust.

6. **Create reusable templates** - The documents you create (problem-analysis.md, impact-estimate.md, experiment-readout.md) become templates for future features.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Claude can't read my CSV file"

**Likely cause:** File path is incorrect or file isn't in the project directory.

**Fix:**
1. Check file path with `ls` or file browser
2. Use correct relative path (e.g., `data/experiment-results.csv`)
3. Verify file is in accessible directory (not hidden folder)
4. Make sure file extension is `.csv` not `.CSV` (case-sensitive on some systems)

---

### "Results don't match what I see in Excel"

**Likely cause:** Different calculations or data interpretation.

**Fix:**
1. Ask Claude to show the calculation step-by-step
2. Verify Claude is using the correct columns
3. Check for data type issues (True/False vs 1/0)
4. Ask Claude: "Explain how you calculated activation rate from this CSV"
5. Cross-check a few rows manually

---

### "Statistical significance seems wrong"

**Likely cause:** Sample size too small, or misunderstanding of p-values.

**Fix:**
1. Check sample size: Need ~400+ users per cohort for reliable significance testing
2. Verify Claude used correct statistical test (proportion test for activation rates)
3. Remember: `p<0.05` means "less than 5% chance this is random" not "5% error"
4. Wide confidence intervals = high uncertainty, even if `p<0.05`
5. Ask Claude: "Explain the p-value and confidence interval in plain English"

---

### "My lift estimate seems too high/low"

**Likely cause:** Incorrect application of the framework or unrealistic assumptions.

**Fix:**
1. Review each component: Users Affected, Current Rate, Expected Lift, Value per Action
2. Check if "Expected Lift" is based on data or wishful thinking
3. Use conservative estimates - better to under-promise
4. Compare to historical lifts from similar features
5. Create three scenarios to bound the estimate
6. Ask Claude: "What assumptions went into this lift estimate? Are they conservative?"

---

### "Segment analysis shows conflicting results"

**Likely cause:** This is actually normal! Features work differently for different users.

**Fix:**
1. This isn't a bug - it's an insight!
2. Features often win for target segment and lose for others
3. Example: Guided onboarding helps small teams (+11pp) but hurts enterprise (-3pp)
4. Solution: Ship to winning segment, exclude losing segment
5. Build different solutions for different segments
6. Document this learning for future features
