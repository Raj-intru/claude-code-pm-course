## Interview

**Q: How's your experience with TaskFlow as a new PM?**

Priya: "It's been a learning curve! I'd never used a tool like this before. At first I was overwhelmed - where do I put tasks? How do I organize projects? What's the right level of detail? But I'm getting better. I basically copied how my manager structures things and adapted from there."

**Q: What made the onboarding hard?**

Priya: "Just the blank screen feeling. I created my first project and was like... now what? I didn't know the best practices. Should I create one big project or multiple small ones? How should I organize tasks? Eventually I asked my manager to share their project as a template. That helped a ton. But I wish TaskFlow had given me some starter templates to learn from."

**Q: What's working well for you now?**

Priya: "Once I got the hang of it, it's pretty intuitive. Creating tasks, assigning people, adding due dates - all straightforward. The comments are great for discussing features with engineers. And I love that I can search quickly. The speed is nice - no waiting for pages to load like some tools I used in school."

**Q: What's frustrating?**

Priya: "Notifications are crazy! I get notified for every little thing. At first I tried to read them all, but it was overwhelming - 30+ notifications a day. Now I mostly ignore them and just check TaskFlow directly. Also, I work late sometimes (trying to prove myself, you know?) and the bright white interface is harsh. Everyone's been talking about wanting dark mode."

**Q: How do you use TaskFlow on mobile?**

Priya: "I check it on my phone during my commute or when I'm away from my desk. But it's not great - lots of scrolling, hard to update tasks, easier to just make a mental note and update later on my laptop. Would be cool if the mobile experience was smoother."

**Q: Tell me about creating your weekly updates.**

Priya: "Oh, I spend way too much time on this. Every week I have to summarize what shipped, what's in progress, what's blocked. I manually go through all my tasks, copy stuff into a doc, format it nicely. Takes like 20-30 minutes. I've seen senior PMs have these polished update formats, and I'm like, how do they do it so fast? If there was a template or automated way to generate updates from task status, that'd be amazing."

**Q: What would make TaskFlow easier for new PMs like you?**

Priya: "Templates and examples! Show me how experienced PMs structure projects. Give me starter templates for common things - like 'feature development project' or 'weekly update format.' And maybe a beginner's guide built into the tool? Right now I'm learning by trial and error and asking colleagues."

**Q: Any other feedback?**

Priya: "The search is great, I use it constantly. Keyboard shortcuts would be cool - I've seen senior people use them and they're so fast. And yeah, dark mode for late work sessions. Overall though, I'm learning to like it. Just wish the onboarding for new users was better."
