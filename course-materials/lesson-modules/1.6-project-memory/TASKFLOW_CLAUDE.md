## Writing Style

**Tone:**
- Clear and outcome-focused
- Active voice (not passive)
- Concise (2-sentence max paragraphs for most content)
- Use "we" not "I" in documentation
- Avoid jargon unless it's standard PM terminology

**Formatting:**
- Always use Oxford commas
- Use bullet points for lists (not numbered unless sequence matters)
- Bold key terms on first use
- Include "Why this matters" sections in PRDs

## Product Terminology

**Required Terms:**
- "Workspace" (NOT "Project" - this is our main container concept)
- "Task" (NOT "Todo" or "Issue")
- "Epic" (NOT "Initiative" or "Theme")
- "PM" = Product Manager (not Project Manager)

## Team Reference

**Leadership:**

## Immutable Rules

**ALWAYS:**

**NEVER:**
