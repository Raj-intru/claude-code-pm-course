# Rumelt's Strategy Kernel

**Source:** Richard Rumelt, "Good Strategy, Bad Strategy"

## What Is The Kernel?

The kernel is the **bare-bones center of a strategy** - the hard core that defines its essential character. A good strategy has three essential parts:

1. **Diagnosis** - What's really going on here?
2. **Guiding Policy** - Our overall approach to dealing with it
3. **Coherent Actions** - Feasible coordinated steps that follow from the policy

## Why This Matters for Product Strategy

Most "strategies" are actually just lists of goals or features. Real strategy involves:
- **Choices** about where to compete and how to win
- **Tradeoffs** about what NOT to do
- **Focus** on a few key actions that reinforce each other

Bad strategy is fluffy, filled with buzzwords, and doesn't make hard choices. Good strategy is crisp, realistic, and actionable.

## Part 1: DIAGNOSIS

### What It Is
A diagnosis **simplifies the overwhelming complexity** of reality by identifying critical aspects of the situation. It names or classifies the challenge, drawing on existing categories or creating new ones.

### Questions to Ask
- What's the actual challenge or opportunity we're facing?
- What are the critical constraints?
- What's really preventing us from achieving our goals?
- What does the competitive landscape look like?
- Where are customers underserved?

### Example: Netflix circa 2007
**Diagnosis:** "We're a DVD-by-mail company in a world moving to streaming. Our core business has a shelf life. If we don't transform, we'll be the next Blockbuster."

### For Product Strategy
Your diagnosis should reveal:
- The core problem or opportunity
- Why now is the right time
- What's changed in the market/technology/customer behavior
- Your current position (strengths and constraints)

## Part 2: GUIDING POLICY

### What It Is
A guiding policy is an **overall approach** chosen to cope with or overcome the obstacles identified in the diagnosis. It channels action in certain directions without defining exactly what shall be done.

### Key Characteristics
- Creates **advantage** - It's not just "work harder" or "be better"
- Makes **tradeoffs** - Says no to some things to focus on others
- Is **coherent** - The parts reinforce each other
- Provides **direction** - But isn't so specific it becomes a project plan

### Example: Netflix circa 2007
**Guiding Policy:** "Become a streaming-first entertainment company, even if it cannibalizes our DVD business. Build original content to differentiate from commodity streaming."

### For Product Strategy
Your guiding policy should answer:
- Who are we targeting? (And who are we NOT targeting?)
- What's our positioning/differentiation?
- What type of product experience are we building?
- What's our unfair advantage?

### Red Flags (Bad Guiding Policy)
❌ "Increase revenue"
❌ "Delight customers"
❌ "Be the market leader"
❌ "Build the best product"

These are **goals**, not strategy. They don't tell you HOW or WHERE to compete.

## Part 3: COHERENT ACTIONS

### What It Is
Coherent actions are **feasible coordinated policies, resource commitments, and actions** designed to carry out the guiding policy. The actions should be coherent - coordinated with one another so they reinforce each other.

### Key Characteristics
- **Specific enough to be actionable** - Not vague aspirations
- **Coordinated** - Each action supports the others
- **Feasible** - Can actually be done with your resources and capabilities
- **Sequential** - Clear what comes first and what depends on what

### Example: Netflix circa 2007
**Coherent Actions:**
1. Launch streaming service (even with limited content)
2. License streaming rights aggressively from studios
3. Invest in recommendation algorithms to help users discover content
4. Eventually produce original content (House of Cards, Orange is the New Black)
5. Expand internationally before competitors can establish themselves

Notice how each action **reinforces** the others. Streaming + recommendations + originals = defensible position.

### For Product Strategy
Your coherent actions should include:
- Key initiatives on the roadmap (sequenced properly)
- Resource allocation decisions
- Technical infrastructure investments
- Go-to-market approach
- Partnership or hiring priorities

### Red Flags (Incoherent Actions)
❌ A laundry list of every idea anyone had
❌ Actions that contradict each other
❌ "We'll do everything for everyone"
❌ No clear dependencies or sequencing

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 1: Start with Diagnosis
Don't jump to solutions! Spend time really understanding:
- What's the challenge/opportunity?
- What do we know from data, research, competitive analysis?
- What are our constraints?

### Step 2: Develop Guiding Policy
Make the hard choices:
- Who's our target customer? (Say no to other segments)
- What's our positioning?
- What's our angle of attack?

Use this test: **Would a reasonable person disagree with this?** If not, it's probably too generic.

### Step 3: Define Coherent Actions
Translate strategy into concrete steps:
- What do we build first, second, third?
- Why that order?
- How do these actions reinforce each other?

### Step 4: Test for Coherence
Ask: Do all these pieces fit together? Would removing any action weaken the whole strategy? Are there conflicting actions?

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Skipping Diagnosis
Jumping straight to "here's what we'll build" without understanding the real problem.

### Mistake 2: Goals Masquerading as Strategy
"We'll grow 50% year-over-year" is not a strategy. HOW will you grow?

### Mistake 3: Wishful Thinking
"We'll be the best at X" - okay, but what gives you the right to win? What's your advantage?

### Mistake 4: Incoherent Actions
Having a laundry list of initiatives that don't reinforce each other - spreading resources thin instead of focusing.

### Mistake 5: No Tradeoffs
Real strategy involves saying NO. If your strategy accommodates everyone's pet projects, it's not a strategy.

## Quick Reference

When developing your product strategy, ensure you can fill in these blanks:

**DIAGNOSIS:**
"The key challenge/opportunity is ___________. This matters because ___________. The critical factors are ___________."

**GUIDING POLICY:**
"Our approach is to ___________ for ___________ [target customer]. We'll differentiate by ___________. This means we won't ___________."

**COHERENT ACTIONS:**
"We'll execute this through: 1) ___________, 2) ___________, 3) ___________. These actions reinforce each other because ___________."

## Remember

**Strategy is about CHOICES, not documents.**

The kernel framework forces you to:
1. Really understand the situation (diagnosis)
2. Make hard tradeoffs (guiding policy)
3. Focus resources coherently (coherent actions)

If you can't articulate your kernel clearly, you don't have a strategy yet.
