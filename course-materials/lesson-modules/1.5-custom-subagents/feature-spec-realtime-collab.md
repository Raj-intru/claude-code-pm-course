# Real-Time Collaboration Feature Spec (Draft)

## Overview
Add real-time collaboration to our document editor so multiple users can edit simultaneously.

## Goals
- Allow 2-10 users to edit the same document at once
- Show cursor positions of other users
- Prevent conflicts when users edit same section
- Works on web and mobile

## User Stories
- As a team member, I want to see who else is editing so I don't overwrite their work
- As a collaborator, I want to see changes appear instantly so we can work together
- As a document owner, I want to see who made what changes for accountability

## Technical Approach
- Use WebSockets for real-time updates
- Operational Transform (OT) or CRDT for conflict resolution
- Store cursor positions and broadcast to all users
- Show colored cursors with user names

## Success Metrics
- 90% of edits sync within 500ms
- Less than 5% conflict rate
- Support at least 10 concurrent editors

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Basic cursor sharing (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Real-time text sync (4 weeks)
- Phase 3: Conflict resolution (3 weeks)
- Phase 4: Mobile support (2 weeks)

## Open Questions
- How do we handle users with poor network connections?
- What happens if WebSocket connection drops?
- Do we need presence indicators (online/offline)?
- Should we show edit history in real-time?

## Resources Needed
- 2 backend engineers (WebSocket infrastructure)
- 2 frontend engineers (UI and sync logic)
- 1 mobile engineer (iOS/Android)
- QA support for testing edge cases
