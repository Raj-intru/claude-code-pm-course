USER RESEARCH SESSION - ONBOARDING FLOW
Date: October 5, 2024
Attendees: You (Senior PM), UX Researcher (Amy), 5 user participants (new signups, watched via Zoom)

RESEARCH GOAL: Understand why activation rate is stuck at 45%. Observe new users going through onboarding, identify friction points.

KEY FINDINGS:

Finding 1 - Empty state overwhelms:
After signup, users see completely empty workspace. 3 out of 5 participants didn't know what to do first. One user closed the browser. Suggests we need better empty state guidance or starter templates.

Finding 2 - Task creation unclear:
Users struggled to find "Create Task" button. It's in top-right corner, but users look at center of screen first. Took average 47 seconds to find button. One user still hadn't found it after 2 minutes.

Finding 3 - Inviting teammates not obvious:
Only 1 out of 5 users invited a teammate during session. Others didn't see the invite prompt. This kills our viral coefficient. We need to make team invites more prominent.

Finding 4 - Tutorial skipped:
4 out of 5 users skipped the tutorial video. "Too long, I'll figure it out." Suggests video tutorials don't work. Need interactive onboarding instead.

Finding 5 - Positive moments:
Users loved the clean design. Once they created their first task, engagement increased significantly. "This is beautiful" was said multiple times.

ACTION ITEMS:
- You to document findings in full research report by Oct 8
- Amy to design improved empty state with templates
- You to propose onboarding improvements in next product sync
- Team to prioritize activation improvements for Q4

RECOMMENDATION: Focus on first 5 minutes of user experience. That's where we lose people.
