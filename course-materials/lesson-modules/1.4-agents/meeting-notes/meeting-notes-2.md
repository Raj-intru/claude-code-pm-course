ENGINEERING STANDUP - BACKEND TEAM
Date: October 7, 2024
Attendees: Mike Rodriguez (CTO), Backend team (5 engineers), Alex Rivera (PM Mobile)

UPDATES:
- API rate limiting completed, deployed to staging. Ready for QA.
- SSO integration (SAML) in progress. Blocker: third-party library documentation is unclear, engineer spent 6 hours debugging. Switching to alternative library.
- Database optimization for enterprise customers showing 40% improvement in query performance. Rolling out to production this week.
- Mobile API endpoints 80% complete. Offline sync proving more complex than estimated.

BLOCKERS:
- SSO integration blocked on library choice. Need 2 more days to evaluate alternatives.
- Mobile offline sync needs design decision: conflict resolution strategy when user edits same task offline and online. Alex to clarify with design team.

ACTION ITEMS:
- Mike to unblock SSO by recommending library (Passport.js vs. alternative)
- Alex to schedule 30min sync with Jordan on conflict resolution UX
- Backend team to complete mobile API endpoints by Oct 14
- QA team to test rate limiting in staging by Oct 10

NOTES: Team morale high. Everyone excited about mobile launch.
