COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS DEEP DIVE
Date: October 4, 2024
Attendees: You (Senior PM), Sarah Chen (Head of Product), Marketing Lead (Lisa), Sales Lead (Tom)

PURPOSE: Review competitive landscape, identify threats and opportunities, inform positioning strategy.

LINEAR ANALYSIS:
Lisa presented findings on Linear's recent growth. They're dominating developer-focused teams. Beautiful UI, keyboard shortcuts, GitHub integration. Raised $50M Series B.

Threat: Linear expanding beyond engineering teams into cross-functional use cases. Directly competitive with us.

Opportunity: Linear still weak for non-technical users (PMs, designers, marketing). We can win cross-functional teams.

ASANA UPDATES:
Asana launched AI features (task auto-categorization, smart suggestions). Tom reports customers asking if we have similar features. We don't - yet.

Threat: Asana's AI capabilities could justify their higher price point.

Opportunity: Asana is slow-moving (enterprise company). We can ship AI features faster if we prioritize.

MONDAY.COM TRENDS:
Monday.com aggressively advertising (Super Bowl commercial, podcast sponsorships). Brand recognition increasing. Customers mention Monday.com in sales calls more frequently now.

Threat: Monday.com outspending us 10:1 on marketing. Mind-share battle.

Opportunity: Monday.com product is still bloated and confusing. Customers churn due to complexity. We win on simplicity.

POSITIONING DISCUSSION:
Team debated our core differentiator. Is it async-first? Fast performance? Beautiful design? Affordability?

Consensus: "Project management built for how remote teams actually work" - emphasizes async, context-rich, cross-functional strengths.

ACTION ITEMS:
- You to compile detailed competitive feature matrix by Oct 10
- Marketing to update website positioning based on discussion
- Sales to create competitive battle cards for sales team
- Sarah to evaluate AI feature opportunities for 2025 roadmap

Next competitive review: January 2025 (quarterly cadence)
