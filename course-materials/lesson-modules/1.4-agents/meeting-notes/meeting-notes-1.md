PRODUCT SYNC - MOBILE APP LAUNCH
Date: October 1, 2024
Attendees: Sarah Chen (Head of Product), Alex Rivera (PM Mobile), Mike Rodriguez (CTO), Jordan Kim (Head of Design)

DISCUSSION:
Mobile app launch is tracking for Q1 2025, but we're seeing scope creep. Engineering wants feature parity with web app, but that would delay launch by 6-8 weeks. Team debated MVP scope - what's truly essential vs. nice-to-have.

Jordan presented designs for mobile onboarding flow. Team loved the simplified task creation interface. Mike raised concerns about offline sync complexity - could add 3 weeks to timeline.

Sarah pushed for launch by end of January to hit Q1 target. Proposed cutting advanced filters and custom fields from v1, adding them in v1.1 (February).

ACTION ITEMS:
- Alex to document final MVP scope by Oct 5
- Mike to validate offline sync timeline by Oct 3
- Jordan to simplify onboarding flow (remove tutorial, add contextual tooltips)
- Sarah to communicate timeline expectations to CEO

DECISION: Ship mobile MVP without advanced filters/custom fields. Launch target: Jan 31, 2025.
