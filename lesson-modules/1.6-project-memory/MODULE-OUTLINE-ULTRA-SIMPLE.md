# Module 1.6: Project Memory - Ultra Simple Outline

## Files Needed to Start
- None (CLAUDE.md will be created during module)

## Files Created During Module
- `TASKFLOW_CLAUDE.md` (example CLAUDE.md for reference - not actually used by Claude Code)

## High-Level Overview
- Introduce the problem: starting from scratch every conversation
- Explain CLAUDE.md as permanent project memory
- Teach the constitution metaphor (CLAUDE.md = constitution, prompts = legislation)
- Demonstrate the # symbol for adding dynamic rules during sessions
- Teach what belongs in CLAUDE.md vs prompts (permanent vs temporary)
- Create TaskFlow CLAUDE.md with product context, personas, writing style, terminology
- Demonstrate the magic: Claude remembers everything automatically
- Explain CLAUDE.md hierarchy (Global > Project > Directory > Local)
- Celebrate Level 1 completion!

## Teaching Flow

- Welcome to Module 1.6: Project Memory (CLAUDE.md) - final module in Level 1!
- Explain the problem: starting from scratch every conversation
- Introduce CLAUDE.md: permanent project memory that loads automatically
- Explain the constitution metaphor (CLAUDE.md = constitution, prompts = legislation)
- Explain # symbol: adds rules dynamically, Claude asks where to save (Global vs Project)
- STOP: Ask user to request "Create a CLAUDE.md for TaskFlow"
- USER: Requests CLAUDE.md creation
- The CLAUDE.md file in this exercise directory is actually how I know the teaching script. In a real project, I would create a CLAUDE.md in your TaskFlow project root. Let me create a TASKFLOW_CLAUDE.md file to show you what that would look like."
- ACTION: Create TASKFLOW_CLAUDE.md with all sections:
	- Product Context (what TaskFlow is)
	- Personas (Sarah, Alex, Maya)
	- Writing Style (clear, outcome-focused)
	- Terminology (standard PM terms)
	- Immutable Rules (format requirements)
- STOP: Ask users if they've viewed the file
- USER: Confirms
- In a real project, this would be named CLAUDE.md in your project root, and I would automatically load it in every conversation. For this demo, I'll manually follow these rules.
- STOP: Ask user to request "Write a user story for dark mode"
- USER: Requests user story
- ACTION: Read TASKFLOW_CLAUDE.md, then write user story following all its rules
- Point out what you did (used personas, style, terminology from TASKFLOW_CLAUDE.md)
- Brief mention: CLAUDE.md hierarchy (Global > Project > Directory > Local)
- Say "For more details, see the reference doc at .claude/project-memory-reference.md"
- STOP: Ask user if they have any more questions
- USER: User confirms no questions
- Celebrate Level 1 Complete! ðŸŽ‰
- Quick recap of all 6 modules:
	- 1.1: Welcome to TaskFlow
	- 1.2: Visualizing Files
	- 1.3: First PM Tasks
	- 1.4: Agents
	- 1.5: Custom Sub-Agents
	- 1.6: Project Memory (this module!)
- You can now: work with files, use agents, create sub-agents, maintain project memory
- Preview: Level 2 = Practitioner modules (applying skills to real work)
- Mission: Take a break, try CLAUDE.md in real work before Level 2
- Say "To start Level 2: /start-2-1"
