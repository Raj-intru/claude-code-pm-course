ROADMAP REVIEW - 2025 PLANNING
Date: October 11, 2024
Attendees: Sarah Chen (Head of Product), You (Senior PM), Alex Rivera (PM Mobile), Engineering Leads (3), Jordan Kim (Design)

OBJECTIVE: Finalize Q1-Q2 2025 roadmap priorities. Balance customer requests, strategic initiatives, and technical debt.

Q1 2025 PRIORITIES (Jan-Mar):
1. Mobile app launch (committed, in progress)
2. Enterprise features: SSO, permissions, audit logs (committed, enterprise blocker)
3. Activation improvements: onboarding redesign, templates (committed, CEO priority)
4. Dark mode (committed, highly requested)

Q2 2025 PRIORITIES (Apr-Jun):
1. Time tracking (customer request, 127 upvotes)
2. Resource management / capacity planning (team lead persona need)
3. Custom workflows (flexibility for complex teams)
4. API v2 (integration partners requesting improvements)

DEFERRED / ICEBOX:
- Whiteboarding feature (nice-to-have, not core competency)
- Goals & OKRs (strategic planning - separate product?)
- Public roadmap (marketing wants, low priority)
- Advanced reporting (niche use case)

TECHNICAL DEBT ALLOCATION:
Engineering Leads requested 20% time for tech debt each sprint. Team agreed. Will improve velocity long-term and reduce bugs.

DISCUSSION:
Alex advocated for native desktop app (Electron). Team decided not yet - web app performance is good enough. Revisit in Q3 if customer demand increases.

Jordan raised concern about design team capacity. Roadmap is ambitious. May need to hire another designer in Q1.

ACTION ITEMS:
- Sarah to share roadmap with CEO for approval
- You to create detailed specs for Q1 activation improvements
- Alex to finalize mobile app launch plan
- Jordan to assess design hiring needs
- Engineering Leads to define tech debt priorities for Q1

Roadmap to be finalized by Oct 18, communicated company-wide Oct 21.
