PRICING STRATEGY DISCUSSION
Date: October 8, 2024
Attendees: CEO, CFO, Sarah Chen (Head of Product), Sales Lead (Tom), You (Senior PM)

CONTEXT:
Reviewing pricing strategy ahead of enterprise push. Current pricing: Free (up to 10 users), Pro ($12/user/month), Enterprise (custom). Competitors charging more, but are we leaving money on table?

DISCUSSION:

Proposal 1 - Raise Pro plan to $15/user/month:
CFO advocates for price increase. "We're 20% cheaper than Asana, we can raise prices." Sales Lead concerned this would hurt mid-market deals. CEO neutral.

Proposal 2 - Add Business tier between Pro and Enterprise:
Your suggestion: $18/user/month with some enterprise features (basic SSO, priority support). Targets companies with 50-200 employees who need more than Pro but aren't ready for full Enterprise.

Proposal 3 - Annual discount adjustment:
Currently offering 20% discount for annual payment. CFO suggests reducing to 15% to improve cash flow. Sales Lead strongly opposed - "annual deals are our bread and butter."

Proposal 4 - Usage-based pricing for integrations:
Some competitors charge for integrations. Could add $2/user/month for "unlimited integrations" tier. Team skeptical - adds complexity, may confuse customers.

DECISION:
Launch Business tier at $18/user/month. Keep Pro pricing stable. Test for 3 months, measure conversion rates from Free → Pro → Business → Enterprise.

ACTION ITEMS:
- You to define Business tier feature set by Oct 15
- CFO to model revenue impact of new tier
- Sales Lead to prepare sales pitch for Business tier
- Marketing to create pricing page updates

Target launch: November 1, 2024
