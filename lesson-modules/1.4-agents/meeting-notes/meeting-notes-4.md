DESIGN REVIEW - DARK MODE IMPLEMENTATION
Date: October 9, 2024
Attendees: Jordan Kim (Head of Design), You (Senior PM), Frontend team lead, UX Designer (Amy)

DISCUSSION:
Jordan walked through dark mode designs. Team reviewed color palette, contrast ratios, accessibility standards. All WCAG AAA compliant - excellent work.

Discussed implementation approach: system preference default vs. manual toggle. Decided on both - respect system preference, but allow manual override. Toggle in user settings menu.

Reviewed edge cases: embedded images/screenshots, syntax highlighting in code blocks, Figma embeds. Most handled well, but Figma embeds look washed out in dark mode. Amy to follow up with Figma team about dark mode embed support.

Frontend lead estimated 2-3 weeks implementation time. Some components need refactoring to support theming. Suggests shipping dark mode in phases: core UI first, then integrations/embeds.

ACTION ITEMS:
- Jordan to finalize color tokens in design system by Oct 12
- Frontend lead to create implementation plan with phases by Oct 11
- Amy to contact Figma about dark mode embed support
- You to update dark mode PRD with phased rollout approach
- Frontend team to begin implementation week of Oct 14

DECISION: Ship dark mode in 2 phases. Phase 1 (core UI) by Nov 15. Phase 2 (integrations) by Dec 1.
