SPRINT PLANNING - CYCLE 23
Date: October 2, 2024
Attendees: Alex Rivera (PM Mobile), Engineering team (8 engineers), Mike Rodriguez (CTO)

SPRINT GOAL: Complete mobile API endpoints and begin UI implementation for task list views.

CAPACITY REVIEW:
Team has 80 story points available (2-week sprint). One engineer on PTO for 3 days. No holidays or team events. Focus time: 70% (accounting for meetings, code reviews).

BACKLOG REVIEW:
- Mobile API endpoints (remaining): 21 points
- Task list view UI: 34 points
- Offline sync foundation: 13 points
- Bug fixes from last sprint: 8 points
- Tech debt: 12 points (API documentation, test coverage)

Committed to sprint: 76 points total. Team comfortable with this load.

NOTABLE DECISIONS:
- Postponed push notifications to next sprint (dependency on backend work)
- Prioritized offline sync foundation over nice-to-have UI polish
- Engineering wants to pay down tech debt now rather than later (smart)

RISKS:
- Offline sync complexity could spill over. Timeboxing to 2 days max.
- Designer availability limited (Jordan traveling for conference). May need to make UI decisions without design input.

ACTION ITEMS:
- Engineers to break down tasks and assign by end of day
- Alex to check in with Jordan about UI decisions before she travels
- Mike to review offline sync approach before implementation starts
- Team to do mid-sprint check-in Oct 9 (async update in Slack)

Sprint runs Oct 2-16. Demo scheduled for Oct 16 at 2pm PT.
