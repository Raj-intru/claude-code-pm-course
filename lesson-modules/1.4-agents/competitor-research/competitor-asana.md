## Overview

Asana is the enterprise project management leader, founded in 2008 by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. Public company (NYSE: ASAN) with 1,000+ employees and 100,000+ paying customers globally. They pioneered many project management workflows we now consider standard. Strong brand recognition and extensive feature set make them the default choice for large organizations.

Asana's core strength lies in enterprise-grade features, integrations, and proven scalability. However, this comes with complexity that can overwhelm smaller teams. Their pricing positions them firmly in the enterprise segment, making them less accessible for startups and SMBs.
