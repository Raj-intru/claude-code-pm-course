# Module 1.4: Agents - Ultra Simple Outline

## Files Needed to Start
- `meeting-notes/meeting-notes-1.md` through `meeting-notes-10.md` (10 messy meeting notes)
- `mobile-research/user-interviews/interview-01.md` through `interview-05.md` (5 user interviews)
- `mobile-research/survey-results.csv` (survey data from 200 users)
- `mobile-research/support-tickets/ticket-01.md` through `ticket-10.md` (10 support tickets)
- `mobile-research/sales-notes.md` (sales team notes about lost deals)

## Files Created During Module
- All 10 meeting notes edited (summaries appended to each)
- `competitor-research/competitor-asana.md` (created by Agent 1 via web search)
- `competitor-research/competitor-linear.md` (created by Agent 2 via web search)
- `competitor-research/competitor-monday.md` (created by Agent 3 via web search)
- `competitor-research/competitor-clickup.md` (created by Agent 4 via web search)
- `competitor-research/competitor-jira.md` (created by Agent 5 via web search)
- `competitive-landscape-matrix.md` (synthesis of all 5 competitor analyses)
- `mobile-app-research-synthesis.md` (4-source research synthesis)

## High-Level Overview
- Introduce the concept of agents (cloning Claude to work in parallel)
- Demonstrate parallel processing with 10 meeting notes processed simultaneously
- Explain what agents are (independent Claude instances), Claude can create them dynamically as a main agent
- Demonstrate competitive research with 5 agents analyzing 5 competitors
- Show advanced orchestration with 4 specialized agents on different data sources
- Explain when to use agents vs regular sequential work
- Preview difference between agents (this module) and custom sub-agents (next module)

## Teaching Flow

- Welcome to Module 1.4: Agents
- Prepare to be amazed
- Scenario: Monday morning, 10 meeting notes from last week need processing
- Normally = 2-3 hours sequentially, with agents = minutes in parallel
- ACTION: List files in meeting-notes/ folder
- STOP: Ask if ready
- USER: Ready
- Say "I'm going to spin up 10 independent agents, each processing one meeting note simultaneously"
- STOP: Ask user to input command to process notes in parallel with individual agents
- USER: Inputs command
- ACTION: Launch 10 agents to process meeting notes
	- Each agent reads one file, extracts action items/decisions/next steps, appends summary to that file
- Say done
- STOP: Ask user to view files
- USER: Viewed files
- STOP: Ask if ready for explanation
- USER: Ready
- STOP: Quick check question (multiple choice about when to use agents)
- USER: Answers
- Respond based on answer
- Explain what agents are
	- Agents = independent instances of Claude working simultaneously
	- Regular Claude = sequential (one thing at a time)
	- Agents = parallel (10 things at same time)
	- Like cloning itself
	- Agents are NOT specialized tools - they're complete Claude instances
- When to use agents
	- Perfect scenarios: Batch processing, Multi-source research, Different data sources
	- When NOT to use: Single tasks, Sequential work, Simple quick tasks
- STOP: Ask if they want to know what happens under the hood (recommended)
- USER: Ready or skip
- What actually happens when spawning agents (under the hood)
	- Main Claude creates a task instruction for each agent ("Read meeting-notes-1.md and extract action items")
	- Each agent gets: The specific task, Access to tools (Read, Write, WebSearch, etc.), Project context if needed
	- Each agent doesn't see: The main conversation, What other agents are doing, Previous interactions
	- Agents execute independently and simultaneously
	- Main Claude collects outputs when agents finish
	- Example: Agent 1 wakes up with one job ("Process meeting-notes-1.md"), does it, and finishes - doesn't know it's an agent
	- This sets foundation for Module 1.5 where you'll pre-configure agent personas 
- STOP: Ask if ready for competitive research and agent orchestration
- USER: Ready
- Competitive research scenario
	- CEO wants competitive landscape update
- Now let's see how Claude Code can break down tasks and spin up agents dynamically
- STOP: Ask if ready
- USER: Ready
- STOP Say ask me to both first research top 5 competitors, spin up agents to research them in parallel and write individual reports, and combine them all into a single synthesis
- ACTION: Research top 5 competitors, launch 5 agents, each researching one competitor via web search
	- Features, pricing, positioning, strengths/weaknesses, opportunities
- ACTION: Each agent creates a competitor file
- ACTION: Create competitive-landscape-matrix.md
	- Feature comparison, pricing analysis, positioning map, gaps & opportunities for TaskFlow
- Say done, show insights and point to file
- We've covered a single type of agent doing the same type of task in parallel
- Claude can also spin up different kinds of agents at the same time to task many different kinds of tasks at once
- Scenario: Need to make decision about building mobile app, have lot of different data sources that require different approaches
- Advanced agent orchestration scenario
	- Researching whether to add mobile app
	- 4 different data sources: User interviews (5 transcripts), Survey data (CSV with 200 responses), Support tickets (10 tickets), Sales notes (lost deals)
	- Key difference: Not just parallel processing - SPECIALIZED agents for different data types
- Instead of 4 identical processes, we're launching 4 SPECIALIZED agents
- STOP: Ask user to input command to analyze the different kinds of data sources with different kinds of agents.
- USER: Inputs command
- ACTION: Launch 4 specialized agents
	- Agent 1: Interview Analyst - Reads all 5 files in user-interviews/, extracts mobile pain points and quotes
	- Agent 2: Survey Analyst - Analyzes survey-results.csv, calculates percentages and segments by user role
	- Agent 3: Support Analyst - Reviews all 10 files in support-tickets/, categorizes mobile requests by use case
	- Agent 4: Sales Analyst - Reads sales-notes.md, identifies lost deals and revenue impact
- ACTION: Create mobile-app-research-synthesis.md
	- Comprehensive analysis with pain points, demand data, use cases, revenue impact, recommendation
- Say done, show key insights from synthesis
- Point out: "This is advanced orchestration - different agents, different specializations, unified output"
- STOP: Ask if ready for recap
- USER: Ready
- Explain agent workflows (repeatable patterns)
	- Workflow 1: Weekly Meeting Processing
	- Workflow 2: Sprint User Story Creation
	- Workflow 3: Multi-Channel User Research
	- Workflow 4: Competitive Intelligence
- How to think about agents
	- Question 1: Can this be broken into independent parallel tasks?
	- Question 2: How many independent tasks? (That's how many agents)
	- Question 3: Are tasks similar or different? (Generic vs specialized agents)
	- Question 4: Will outputs need combining? (Plan synthesis step)
- STOP: Ask if ready for what's next
- USER: Ready
- Recap Module 1.4 complete
	- You understand: What agents are, Power of parallel processing, When to use agents, Agent orchestration, Agent workflows, The aha! moment
- Distinction: Agents vs Custom Sub-Agents
	- Agents (Module 1.4): Ad-hoc created on the fly, Temporary for immediate parallel work, Generic capabilities
	- Custom Sub-Agents (Module 1.5): Pre-configured personas you create once, Permanent team members, Call them by name
	- Think: Agents = temp contractors, Sub-Agents = permanent employees
- Preview Module 1.5
	- Build your dream PM team
	- Specialized personas with colors and emojis
	- Engineer, Executive, User Researcher, etc.
- STOP: When ready for Module 1.5
