# Module 1.5: Custom Sub-Agents - Ultra Simple Outline

## Files Needed to Start
- `.claude/agents/engineer.md` (üë®‚Äçüíª Engineer sub-agent - pre-built)
- `.claude/agents/executive.md` (üíº Executive sub-agent - pre-built)
- `.claude/agents/user-researcher.md` (üë§ User Researcher sub-agent - pre-built)
- `feature-spec-realtime-collab.md` (rough feature spec to be reviewed by all three sub-agents)

## Files Created During Module
- `feature-spec-review.md` (consolidated reviews from all three sub-agents)

## High-Level Overview
- Introduce custom sub-agents (permanent team members with personalities vs temporary agents)

- Have all three sub-agents review `feature-spec-realtime-collab.md` from different perspectives using natural language
- Show how multiple specialized perspectives improve your work
- Explain the hidden `.claude/agents/` folder and how to access it
- Break down sub-agent file structure from `.claude/agents/engineer.md` (Name, Color, Persona, Expertise)
- Explain difference between agents (Module 1.4) and custom sub-agents (permanent vs temporary)
- Point to 100+ pre-built agents available in community libraries that users can easily copy into their projects

## Teaching Flow

- Welcome to Module 1.5: Custom Sub-Agents
- This is where you build your specialized PM team
- In Module 1.4 you learned about agents - cloning Claude for parallel work
- Module 1.5 is different - you're creating permanent team members with personalities
- Think of it like this: agents = temp contractors, sub-agents = permanent employees
- STOP: Any questions about the difference so far?
- USER: Responds or says continue
- I've pre-built three specialized team members for you in `.claude/agents/`
- STOP: Ask user to say "Show me the team"
- USER: Says "Show me the team"
- üë®‚Äçüíª Engineer (purple) - Technical feedback and feasibility
- üíº Executive (blue) - Stakeholder communication and strategic framing
- üë§ User Researcher (green) - Research analysis and pain point synthesis
- These sub-agents have distinct personalities, expertise areas, and even visual identities with emojis and colors
- Let me show you how powerful this is by having all three review the same feature spec
- We have a rough feature spec at `feature-spec-realtime-collab.md`
- STOP: Tell user to ask all three sub-agents to review the feature spec from their different perspectives and consolidate into `feature-spec-review.md`
- USER: Asks Engineer, Executive, and User Researcher to review the spec and write consolidated feedback to feature-spec-review.md
- ACTION: Have all three sub-agents review `feature-spec-realtime-collab.md` and create `feature-spec-review.md` with consolidated feedback
	- Engineer section: Technical feasibility, implementation challenges, performance considerations
	- Executive section: Business value framing, strategic positioning, stakeholder communication
	- User Researcher section: User pain points, missing context, research validation needed
- STOP: Ask user to open and read `feature-spec-review.md`
- USER: Opens the file
- See that? Three different expert perspectives on the same document in one consolidated review
- The Engineer caught technical challenges you'd miss
- The Executive helped you frame it for leadership
- The User Researcher ensured you're solving real user problems
- Here's what just happened behind the scenes - this is important
- I'm the main orchestrating agent coordinating everything
- You gave me a task: get feedback from three specialists
- I called each sub-agent (Engineer, Executive, User Researcher) with their specific instructions
- Each sub-agent provided their specialized perspective
- Then I combined all three reviews into one consolidated file
- Think of it like being a PM with a team: you delegate to specialists, they do their work, you synthesize the results
- This is the power of custom sub-agents - getting multiple specialized perspectives instantly
- And you didn't have to type emojis - just say "Use the Engineer subagent" naturally
- STOP: Does the orchestration concept make sense?
- USER: Responds or says continue
- STOP: Ask which sub-agent file user wants to examine
- USER: Chooses a sub-agent
- Let me show you how these sub-agents are structured
- They live in a hidden folder called `.claude/agents/`
- You can't see it in Obsidian because it starts with a dot (hidden folder)
- ACTION: Explain how to access `.claude/agents/` folder
	- Mac: Press Shift+Command+. in Finder to show hidden files
	- Windows: Enable "Hidden items" in File Explorer View tab
	- Then navigate to your project and open `.claude/agents/`
- STOP: Were you able to find the folder? Any questions about accessing it?
- USER: Responds or says continue
- ACTION: Read and display the chosen sub-agent file structure
- Here's what makes up a sub-agent file
- Section 1: Name with emoji (# üë®‚Äçüíª Engineer)
	- The emoji appears when the sub-agent responds
	- Makes it visually distinct in your terminal
- Section 2: Color (purple, blue, green, etc.)
	- Color codes the sub-agent's responses
	- Helps you quickly see who's "talking"
- Section 3: Persona (2-3 paragraphs)
	- Who they are (background, experience)
	- How they think (technical, strategic, user-focused)
	- Communication style (direct, empathetic, pragmatic)
	- What value they provide to you as a PM
- Section 4: Expertise (bulleted list)
	- Specific skills and knowledge areas
	- When to call on them
	- What they're expert at
- This isn't just a prompt - it's a personality
- Once you create a sub-agent, they're available forever in this project
- STOP: Ask if user understands difference between Module 1.4 agents and Module 1.5 sub-agents
- USER: Responds
- Let me clarify the key distinction
- Module 1.4 agents: Temporary clones for parallel batch work
	- "Create 10 agents to process 10 meeting notes"
	- One-time tasks done simultaneously
	- Generic capabilities
- Module 1.5 sub-agents: Permanent specialized team members
	- "Use the Engineer subagent to review this spec"
	- Repeated use with consistent personality
	- Specialized perspectives
- Both are powerful but for different reasons
- Use agents when you need parallel processing NOW
- Use sub-agents when you need specialized perspectives REPEATEDLY
- STOP: Does this distinction make sense?
- USER: Responds or says continue
- Now here's the best part - you don't have to create all these from scratch
- There are 100+ pre-built sub-agents in community libraries
- You can copy Engineer, QA Tester, Data Analyst, Technical Writer, and many more
- Check the reference guide for links to these libraries
- Just copy the `.md` files into your `.claude/agents/` folder and they're ready to use
- STOP: Ask user to say "What did I learn?"
- USER: Says "What did I learn?"
- Here's what you learned in Module 1.5
- Custom sub-agents are pre-configured personas with roles, colors, and emojis
- Different from Module 1.4 - permanent team members vs temporary workers
- You have three pre-built sub-agents ready to use (Engineer, Executive, User Researcher)
- Call them with natural language - no emoji typing required
- Multiple sub-agents can review the same work from different perspectives
- Sub-agents live in `.claude/agents/` folder (hidden folder)
- Each sub-agent has Name, Color, Persona, and Expertise sections
- 100+ pre-built agents available in community libraries to copy
- What's next? Module 1.6: Project Memory with CLAUDE.md
- You'll learn how to give Claude permanent memory about your product
- Claude will always remember your product context, personas, writing style, and business goals
- No more re-explaining every session
- STOP: When ready for Module 1.6 say "/start-1-6"
