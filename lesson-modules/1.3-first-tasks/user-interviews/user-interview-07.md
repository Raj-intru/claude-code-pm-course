## Interview

**Q: How does TaskFlow fit into your sales workflow?**

Marcus: "We use Salesforce for deal tracking, but we use TaskFlow for everything around deals - follow-up tasks, deal reviews, customer onboarding coordination. Each big deal gets a TaskFlow project where we coordinate all the moving pieces - legal review, security questionnaire, custom demo, pricing approval."

**Q: What's working well?**

Marcus: "The visibility is great. I can see where deals are getting stuck. Sales reps update tasks, I can check in without micromanaging. We can loop in legal, security, whoever we need. Much better than the scattered email threads we had before."

**Q: What's frustrating?**

Marcus: "I travel constantly - meeting customers, attending sales kickoffs, visiting field offices. The mobile experience is rough. I need to check deal status on the go, add quick notes, reassign tasks. The mobile web version works, but it's slow and clunky. I end up waiting until I'm back at my hotel to do updates."

**Q: You mentioned onboarding new sales reps - how does that work?**

Marcus: "Huge pain point. We have a 30-day onboarding program for new reps - product training, shadowing calls, first solo demo, quota ramp. I have a master checklist, but I manually recreate it for each new hire. We're hiring 2-3 reps per quarter. If I could just duplicate a template project, that'd save me hours. Right now it's copy-paste hell."

**Q: How do you handle deal reviews?**

Marcus: "Every week we review all active deals. I go through TaskFlow, check task completion, spot blockers. But it's manual - I'm literally opening each project, scanning tasks, making notes. Would be awesome if TaskFlow could auto-generate a deal status report. Like, 'These 3 deals have overdue tasks, these 2 are blocked, these 5 are on track.'"

**Q: Tell me about notifications.**

Marcus: "Too many. Way too many. Our team is fast-paced - deals move quickly, tasks get updated constantly. I get probably 60-70 notifications a day. I've had to turn most off. But then sometimes I miss a critical update - like, legal has a question blocking a deal. I need smart notifications - urgent stuff immediately, everything else once daily."

**Q: What about dark mode?**

Marcus: "Our sales team would love it. They work late prepping for next-day meetings, catching up on the East Coast or calling APAC. The bright white screen at 10pm is not ideal. I've heard this request from multiple reps."

**Q: If you could have one feature?**

Marcus: "Templates, hands down. The amount of duplicate work we do setting up onboarding projects, recurring deal review checklists, quarterly planning structures - it's massive. We'd save hours every month. After that, better reporting and mobile improvements."
