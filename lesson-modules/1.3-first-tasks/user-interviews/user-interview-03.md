## Interview

**Q: How does TaskFlow fit into your team's workflow?**

Lisa: "We do two-week sprints. At the start of each sprint, I create a project in TaskFlow with all the tasks. Engineers pull tasks as they complete work. I check the board daily to see who's working on what, identify any blockers. We've basically eliminated standup meetings - everyone just updates their tasks and I can see status at a glance."

**Q: What's working well?**

Lisa: "The workload view is great. I can see if someone has too many tasks assigned and rebalance. Before TaskFlow, I had no visibility - I'd find out someone was overloaded when they're already burned out. Now I can catch it early. The board view is also good for sprint planning - we drag tasks into the sprint and assign them."

**Q: What's not working well?**

Lisa: "Reporting is painful. Every week I have to report up to the VP of Engineering - are we on track, what's blocked, what's the velocity. Right now I manually count completed tasks and make a slide deck. TaskFlow has some reports but they're basic. I want automatic burndown charts, velocity trends, forecasting. Like 'at current pace, you'll finish 2 days late.'"

**Q: Tell me about blockers.**

Lisa: "Blockers are CRITICAL for me. When an engineer is blocked, I need to know immediately. Right now they have to manually tag a task as blocked and write a comment. I wish blocked tasks were more visible - like, red flag, alert me somehow. Or even better, if a task hasn't been updated in 3 days, automatically flag it as potentially blocked."

**Q: How do you use TaskFlow for team visibility?**

Lisa: "I have a dashboard saved with my team's tasks. I check it 3-4 times a day. I can see who's heads-down on work, who just finished something and needs a new task. But the dashboard is pretty basic. I want to see more - like, how many tasks each person completed this week, average cycle time, that kind of thing. Help me spot patterns."

**Q: What about cross-team collaboration?**

Lisa: "My team works with the design team and the product team. TaskFlow is okay for this but could be better. Sometimes designers attach Figma links, sometimes they don't. Sometimes PMs write detailed specs, sometimes they don't. I wish there were requirements - like, 'this task can't be started until a Figma mockup is attached.' Enforce the process a bit."

**Q: How do you handle onboarding new engineers?**

Lisa: "I create a training project with tasks like 'set up dev environment,' 'complete first code review,' etc. Works okay. But I'm basically rebuilding this for each new hire. A template would be nice - I could just duplicate the onboarding project. Actually, templates for common project types would be great - sprint planning, hiring pipeline, etc."

**Q: What features would make your job easier?**

Lisa: "Better reporting, definitely. Automatic insights - like, 'velocity decreased 20% this sprint, investigate.' Workload forecasting - 'if you assign these 5 tasks, Mike will be overloaded.' Blocked task visibility. And honestly, dark mode - half my team works late and they keep asking for it."

**Q: How does TaskFlow compare to tools you've used before?**

Lisa: "We used Jira before. Jira is powerful but SO complicated. TaskFlow is refreshing - it's simple but not TOO simple. It does what we need without overwhelming us with options. But we're hitting the limits now. As the team grows, I need more manager-level features. Right now it's great for individual contributors, but us managers need more tools."

## Key Insights
- Team visibility is primary use case
- Workload view highly valued (prevent burnout)
- Reporting is major pain point (manual, time-consuming)
- Needs automatic insights and forecasting
- Blocked task visibility critical but currently manual
- Dashboard is useful but too basic (wants metrics)
- Templates would help (onboarding, common projects)
- Cross-team collaboration could be better (required fields)
- Dark mode requested by team
- Tool is good for ICs but lacking manager-level features
- Eliminated standup meetings (async status updates)
