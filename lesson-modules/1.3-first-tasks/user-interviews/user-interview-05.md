## Interview

**Q: How does your team use TaskFlow?**

James: "We track everything in TaskFlow - customer onboarding projects, support escalations, account health check-ins, feature requests from customers. Each enterprise customer has a project. We update tasks as we move through onboarding milestones or resolve issues."

**Q: What's working well for your use case?**

James: "The ability to track multiple customers in parallel is great. I can see at a glance which customers are at risk, which are in onboarding, which need check-ins. Custom fields help - we tag by customer tier, ARR, health score. And linking to Slack is helpful for getting quick updates."

**Q: What pain points do you encounter?**

James: "The mobile experience is tough. I'm often checking customer status on the go - between meetings, at conferences, traveling. The mobile web version is clunky. I can't easily update tasks or add notes. Sometimes I wait until I'm back at my laptop, which delays customer responses."

**Q: You mentioned customer onboarding - how does that work?**

James: "I've created a master onboarding template - a checklist of 20+ tasks every enterprise customer goes through. But here's the thing: I have to manually recreate it for each new customer. Would save so much time if I could just duplicate a template project. I've literally copy-pasted the same project structure 15 times this quarter."

**Q: Tell me about tracking customer feedback.****

James: "Customers request features all the time. I create tasks for each request, tag them, try to spot patterns. But it's manual. Like, five customers might request dark mode, and I have to remember to mention that in our next product sync. Would be cool if TaskFlow could automatically surface: 'Hey, 5 customers in the last month requested this.'"

**Q: How do you use notifications?**

James: "They're overwhelming. I get notified for every comment, every update. I've tried turning some off, but then I miss critical escalations. What I really need is smart notifications - like, alert me immediately if a task is tagged 'urgent' or if a P0 customer has an update, but batch everything else into a morning digest."

**Q: What about collaboration with other teams?**

James: "I work closely with product, engineering, and sales. Sometimes a customer issue needs engineering help - I'll tag someone, they might not see it for hours. Would be great to have SLAs or auto-escalation. Like, if a P0 customer task hasn't been touched in 2 hours, automatically notify my manager."

**Q: If you had a magic wand for one feature?**

James: "Templates. Seriously. The amount of time I spend recreating the same project structure for each customer is ridiculous. After that, better mobile. And yeah, dark mode - I work late doing customer check-ins in different time zones."

## Key Insights
- Template library would save significant time (manual project recreation)
- Mobile experience critical for on-the-go customer management
- Notification overload (needs smart filtering/urgency-based)
- Dark mode requested (late hours due to time zone coverage)
- Pattern detection from customer feedback desired
- SLA/auto-escalation features needed
- Cross-team collaboration could be improved (tagging not always effective)
- Custom fields working well for segmentation
