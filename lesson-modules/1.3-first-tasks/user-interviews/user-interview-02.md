## Interview

**Q: How do you use TaskFlow in your daily workflow?**

David: "First thing in the morning - check TaskFlow. See what's assigned to me, what's due today, what's high priority. I mostly use keyboard shortcuts - I barely touch my mouse. Cmd+K to search, J and K to navigate tasks. It's fast, which is critical. If a tool is slow, I just won't use it."

**Q: What do you like most about TaskFlow?**

David: "Speed. Seriously, it loads instantly. No spinners, no lag. I came from Linear which is also fast, but TaskFlow feels snappier. The GitHub integration is killer - I can link PRs to tasks and the status auto-updates when I merge. That's huge for me. Less manual updating."

**Q: What's frustrating about TaskFlow?**

David: "No dark mode! I work late sometimes, bright white interface hurts my eyes. I've installed browser extensions to force dark mode but it looks janky. This is like the #1 thing I want. Also, the mobile web version is rough. I check tasks on my phone sometimes and it's not great - too much scrolling, hard to read context."

**Q: Tell me about how you get task context.**

David: "Context is super important. If a task just says 'fix login bug' with no details, I waste time hunting for information. Good PMs on our team write detailed descriptions - they include background, edge cases, links to relevant docs. That's when TaskFlow shines. The markdown support is great - they can include code snippets, links, everything I need."

**Q: How about notifications?**

David: "Ugh. Too many. I get emails for everything. Someone comments on a task, I get an email. Someone assigns me something, I get an email. Someone breathes near a task I'm watching, I get an email. I've basically turned most notifications off. I just check TaskFlow manually a few times a day. There should be digest mode - like, send me ONE email with all updates, not 20 separate emails."

**Q: What about team collaboration?**

David: "Comments work well. I like that I can @mention people and they get notified. Threading is good for keeping discussions organized. But honestly, a lot of our collaboration still happens in Slack. We discuss in Slack, then someone updates the task. Would be cool if Slack integration was better - like, post in Slack and it automatically adds a comment to the linked task."

**Q: If you could add one feature, what would it be?**

David: "Dark mode. Hands down. After that, maybe offline support? I work on planes sometimes and it'd be nice to at least view tasks offline. Oh, and API access - I'd love to script some automations. Like, auto-create tasks from error monitoring alerts."

**Q: How does TaskFlow compare to Linear?**

David: "Linear has slightly better UX for engineers - the keyboard shortcuts are more comprehensive. And they have dark mode! But TaskFlow is better for cross-functional teams. Our PMs and designers use TaskFlow, but they found Linear too engineering-focused. So TaskFlow works better for the whole team."

**Q: Any other feedback?**

David: "Search could be better. Right now it's just text search. I want to search by custom fields, or combine filters. Like 'show me all high priority tasks assigned to me in the API project due this week.' I can kind of do that with filters but search would be faster."

- Dark mode is #1 feature request (impacts retention)
- GitHub integration highly valued
- Keyboard shortcuts are essential (power user behavior)
- Mobile web experience inadequate
- Notification overload - needs digest mode
- Task context (detailed descriptions) very important
- Slack integration could be better (two-way sync)
- Search functionality could be more powerful
- Markdown support for technical detail appreciated
