## Interview

**Q: Why did you switch from Monday.com to TaskFlow?**

Sarah: "Monday.com was colorful and flexible, but it was slow. Like, painfully slow. We were also the only team on it - product and engineering were on TaskFlow, so we were constantly switching tools. The CEO wanted everyone on one platform, and TaskFlow won."

**Q: How's it working for marketing use cases?**

Sarah: "Better than I expected! We track campaigns, content calendars, event planning. The board view works well for seeing campaign status. We can attach creative assets, track deadlines. It's not perfect for marketing, but it's good enough, and being on the same tool as product helps with launch coordination."

**Q: What's working well?**

Sarah: "Integration with our workflow is seamless now. When product launches a feature, we can link our launch tasks to their development tasks. We see when things are delayed, we can plan accordingly. And it's fast - Monday.com had constant loading spinners. TaskFlow is snappy."

**Q: What's not working well?**

Sarah: "The notification situation is insane. We run multiple campaigns at once - each has dozens of tasks, multiple people collaborating. I get easily 40-50 notifications a day. I've muted most of them, but then I miss important updates. I'd love notification rules - like, only notify me about campaign launch tasks, batch everything else."

**Q: Tell me about your team's workflow.****

Sarah: "We have recurring campaign types - product launches, webinars, blog posts, social campaigns. Every product launch follows the same playbook: brief, creative development, review, scheduling, launch, analysis. I rebuild this structure every single time. A template would be a game-changer. I'd save probably 30 minutes per campaign, we do 3-4 campaigns a month."

**Q: How's the mobile experience?**

Sarah: "Not great for marketing. I'm at conferences a lot, checking task status between sessions. The mobile web version is functional but clunky. Hard to attach images, hard to review creative assets, lots of scrolling. I mostly just check status and wait until I'm on my laptop to do real work."

**Q: What about dark mode?**

Sarah: "Oh my gosh, yes! Our team works across time zones - APAC, EMEA, US. Someone's always working late. The bright white interface is harsh for evening work. Multiple people have asked for dark mode. It's a running joke on our team Slack."

**Q: Any other feedback?**

Sarah: "The custom fields are great for us - we tag by campaign type, channel, budget tier. That's working well. But better templates and smarter notifications would transform how we use TaskFlow. Right now we spend too much time recreating structures and drowning in notification noise."

## Key Insights
- Templates highly desired (recurring campaign structures)
- Notification overload severe (40-50/day, most muted)
- Dark mode requested (global team, late hours)
- Mobile experience inadequate for creative review
- Speed/performance major improvement over Monday.com
- Cross-team coordination (with product) working well
- Custom fields working well for campaign segmentation
- Time savings estimate: 30 min per campaign with templates (= 2 hours/month)
