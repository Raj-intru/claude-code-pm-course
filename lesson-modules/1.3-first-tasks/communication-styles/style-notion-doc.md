# Communication Style: Notion Document

## Purpose
Comprehensive reference document that anyone can read asynchronously and get complete context.

## Format Rules
- **Length:** As long as needed to be thorough (typically 300-600 words)
- **Tone:** Professional but accessible, detailed, well-organized
- **Structure:**
  - **Title:** Clear, descriptive headline
  - **Summary:** 2-3 sentence TL;DR at the top
  - **Sections:** Use H2 headers to organize (Background, Key Findings, Recommendations, Next Steps)
  - **Lists:** Bullet points for scannability
  - **Tables:** Optional for organizing data/findings
  - **Callouts:** Use for important insights or action items
- **Include:** Full context, supporting details, direct quotes, specific examples
- **Avoid:** Assuming prior knowledge, skipping important context
- **Focus:** Being a comprehensive, standalone reference

## Example

**Input:** User research showed 8/8 users struggled with onboarding, taking 45+ minutes to complete first task. Top pain points: unclear navigation (6 mentions), no templates (5 mentions), overwhelming blank screen (4 mentions). Recommended: add interactive tour and template library.

**Output:**

# User Research Report: TaskFlow Onboarding Study

**TL;DR:** All 8 users struggled significantly with onboarding (45+ min avg to first task). Primary issues: navigation confusion, lack of templates, overwhelming blank-screen experience. Recommending interactive tour + template library for Q1.

## Background

We conducted 8 user interviews (Oct 2-6) with new TaskFlow users to understand onboarding friction points. Participants were recruited from recent trial signups and represented a mix of roles (PMs, engineers, marketers) and team sizes (solo to 50+ people).

**Research Goals:**
- Identify friction points in first-time user experience
- Understand time-to-first-task completion
- Compare our onboarding to competitor experiences
- Generate recommendations for Q1 activation improvements

## Key Findings

### 1. Time-to-Value is Too Long
- **Average time to complete first task: 45 minutes**
- All 8 users (100%) struggled with initial setup
- Competitors average 15 minutes (Linear, Asana)
- Current activation rate: 45% (target: 60%)

### 2. Navigation is Confusing (6/8 users)
Users couldn't find basic features:
- "I didn't know where to click to create my first project"
- "I kept looking for templates but couldn't find them"
- "The sidebar wasn't obvious as navigation"

### 3. Lack of Templates Increases Friction (5/8 users)
Users want pre-built starting points:
- "I stared at a blank screen not knowing what to do"
- "I wish there were examples I could start from"
- "Notion has templates — why don't you?"

### 4. Blank-Screen Experience is Overwhelming (4/8 users)
The empty workspace intimidates new users:
- "I felt like I had to build everything from scratch"
- "It's too much freedom without guidance"

## Competitive Comparison

| Platform | Time-to-First-Task | Has Templates | Has Interactive Tour |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| TaskFlow | 45 min | ❌ | ❌ |
| Asana | 12 min | ✅ | ✅ |
| Linear | 15 min | ❌ | ✅ |
| ClickUp | 18 min | ✅ | ✅ |

## Recommendations

### Primary: Interactive Product Tour
- Guide users through key features on first login
- Progressive disclosure (don't overwhelm)
- Can be skipped but defaults to "on"
- Engineering estimate: 2 sprints

### Primary: Template Library
- 5-7 pre-built project templates
- Categories: Product Launch, Sprint Planning, Bug Tracking, Content Calendar
- Shown immediately after signup
- Engineering estimate: 3 sprints (web), 1 sprint (mobile later)

### Secondary: Navigation Improvements
- More prominent sidebar labels
- Contextual hints for new users
- Included in interactive tour

## Next Steps

1. **This week:** Detailed PRD for both initiatives
2. **Next week:** Engineering breakdown and timeline
3. **Oct 16:** Design review (Jordan's wireframes)
4. **Oct 18:** Final Q1 prioritization decision

**Owner:** [Your name]
**Stakeholders:** Sarah (Product), Jordan (Design), Jamie (Engineering)
**Timeline:** Q1 2024 (if prioritized)
