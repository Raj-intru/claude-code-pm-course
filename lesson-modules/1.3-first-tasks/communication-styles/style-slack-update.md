## Example

**Input:** User research showed 8/8 users struggled with onboarding, taking 45+ minutes to complete first task. Top pain points: unclear navigation (6 mentions), no templates (5 mentions), overwhelming blank screen (4 mentions). Recommended: add interactive tour and template library.

**Output:**

ðŸŽ¯ Just wrapped up 8 user interviews on onboarding â€” every single user struggled to complete their first task (45+ min avg). Main culprits: confusing navigation and that intimidating blank screen when you first log in.

ðŸ’¡ We're going to add an interactive tour + template library to help new users get to value faster. Will share detailed findings in #product-updates!
