**Output:**

**Subject: User Research Findings: Onboarding Friction Points & Q1 Recommendations**

We completed 8 user interviews this week focused on our onboarding experience. The findings reveal significant friction: 100% of users struggled to complete their first task, with average time-to-value at 45+ minutes. The primary barriers are navigation confusion (mentioned by 75% of users), lack of starting templates (62%), and the overwhelming blank-screen experience new users encounter.

This directly impacts our activation rate, which currently sits at 45% against our Q1 OKR target of 60%. Our competitors (Linear, Asana) average 15-minute time-to-first-task, giving them a significant advantage in trial-to-paid conversion. Addressing these onboarding issues could improve activation by 15-20 percentage points based on industry benchmarks, representing approximately $180K in additional ARR this quarter.

We're recommending two initiatives for Q1: an interactive product tour and a template library with 5-7 pre-built project templates. Engineering estimates this at 3 sprints for the web version. I'll have a detailed implementation plan by end of week for review.
