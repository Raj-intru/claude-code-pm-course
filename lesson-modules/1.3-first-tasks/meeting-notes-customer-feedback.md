# Customer Feedback Session - Friday Oct 11, 3pm

attendees: me (PM), customer success team (3 people), 2 enterprise customers on video

## Customer 1: TechCorp (450 employees, $18K/year plan)

Contact: Jennifer Martinez, VP Operations

**What they love:**
- speed! way faster than their previous tool (asana)
- github integration "saves us tons of manual work"
- cleaner interface than jira

**Pain Points:**

1. **Dark mode missing**
   - "our dev team works late, they keep asking for this"
   - "it's literally the #1 request from our engineers"
   - they've tried browser extensions but "breaks stuff"

2. **Onboarding new team members is rough**
   - "new hires stare at blank screen, don't know what to do"
   - they manually created training docs
   - "wish there were starter templates - like here's how to set up a project"

3. **Mobile is barely usable**
   - jennifer checks taskflow on phone between meetings
   - "mobile web version is really clunky"
   - "i mostly just check status, can't really DO anything on mobile"

**Feature requests:**
- dark mode (said this 3 times!)
- better mobile app
- template library for common project types

## Customer 2: DataSystems Inc (850 employees, $42K/year plan)

Contact: Robert Kim, Director of Engineering

**What's working:**
- team adoption was smooth
- sso integration "exactly what we needed"
- performance is good

**Pain Points:**

1. **Notification overload**
   - "people get 40-50 emails a day"
   - most users have turned notifications OFF entirely
   - "they miss important updates because they're drowning in noise"

2. **Dark mode!!**
   - robert: "can i just add my voice to the chorus? we need dark mode"
   - "i have engineers working night shift for asia coverage"
   - "bright white screen at midnight is brutal"

3. **Templates desperately needed**
   - "we onboard 2-3 engineers per month"
   - "i recreate the same onboarding checklist EVERY time"
   - "would save probably an hour per new hire if i could just duplicate"

**Other feedback:**
- audit logs need more detail (compliance req)
- reporting could be better
- but overall they're happy, would recommend

---

## Key Themes from Both Customers:

### Most Critical (both mentioned):
1. **Dark mode** - both customers, multiple mentions, blocks engineer satisfaction
2. **Templates** - both customers, concrete time savings (1 hr per use case)
3. **Mobile experience** - clunky, limits usage

### Secondary:
- Notification overload (DataSystems mentioned heavily)
- Onboarding experience (TechCorp mentioned)
- Reporting/audit logs (enterprise needs)

---

## Customer Success Team Input:

After customers left, CS team shared additional context:

- "dark mode comes up in 60%+ of enterprise sales calls"
- "we've lost 2 deals this quarter because of missing features"
  - one wanted better mobile
  - one needed more advanced permissions
- "templates would reduce support tickets - lots of 'how do i structure this' questions"

---

## Action Items:

- me: share this feedback with sarah and product team
- me: check how many support tickets mention dark mode (probably a lot)
- customer success: track feature requests more systematically
- me: competitive analysis - do our competitors have these features?

---

## My Thoughts:

Dark mode is clearly the most requested feature. We keep hearing it:
- user interviews (3/3 mentioned)
- these enterprise customers (both mentioned)
- support tickets (need to pull data)
- team eng happiness survey

Templates also really clear - concrete time savings, multiple personas need it

Should probably prioritize both for Q1
