# PM Workflow Example

Imagine this typical PM workflow:

**Morning:**
- Ask Claude to summarize yesterday's meeting notes
- Watch the summary file appear in Obsidian
- Read it, make edits if needed
- Share with team

**Afternoon:**
- Ask Claude to draft a PRD from user research
- See the PRD appear in real-time
- Review it in Obsidian while chatting with Claude
- Ask for revisions: "Make section 3 more technical"
- Watch the changes happen live

**End of day:**
- Ask Claude to process all action items from today
- See the organized list appear
- Know exactly what to do tomorrow

This is your new reality! You work WITH Claude, seeing everything, always in control.
