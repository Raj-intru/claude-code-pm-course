# Gibson Biddle's DHM Model

**Source:** Gibson Biddle, former VP Product at Netflix

## What Is DHM?

DHM stands for **Delight**, **Hard to copy**, and **Margin-enhancing**. It's a framework for evaluating product strategy, particularly for consumer products.

A strong product strategy scores well on all three dimensions. Weak strategies might delight customers but aren't defensible or don't improve the business model.

---

## The Three Factors

### D = DELIGHT

**Question:** How does this delight customers in a hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing way?

#### What It Means
- Does this solve a meaningful customer problem?
- Is the solution significantly better than alternatives?
- Will customers love it (not just tolerate it)?
- Does it create authentic value?

#### Testing for Delight
- Customer satisfaction scores
- NPS (Net Promoter Score)
- Usage metrics and retention
- Qualitative feedback ("I love this!")
- Would customers be upset if you removed it?

#### Example: Netflix Recommendations
**Delight:** Helps users discover content they'll love from a massive catalog. Reduces decision paralysis. Personalized to individual taste.

**Test:** Would users complain if recommendations disappeared? Absolutely.

#### For Product Strategy
Ask yourself:
- What customer pain point are we solving?
- How is our solution 10x better than alternatives?
- What makes this delightful vs. merely functional?
- Do we have evidence customers will love this?

#### Red Flags
❌ "Customers want this" (based on one loud person's feedback)
❌ "It's a nice-to-have feature"
❌ Adding features competitors have just to have parity
❌ No evidence of real pain point or customer excitement

### H = HARD TO COPY

**Question:** What makes this defensible? Why can't competitors easily replicate it?

#### What It Means
- Network effects
- Brand/reputation
- Data moats
- Technical complexity
- Cost structure advantages
- Ecosystem lock-in
- First-mover advantage (rare!)

#### Types of Defensibility

**1. Network Effects**
- Value increases with more users
- Example: Messaging apps, marketplaces

**2. Data Moats**
- Proprietary data that improves the product
- Example: Netflix's viewing data improves recommendations

**3. Technical Complexity**
- Hard engineering problems that take time to solve
- Example: Google's search algorithm in early days

**4. Ecosystem Lock-in**
- Integration that makes switching costly
- Example: Apple's hardware + software ecosystem

**5. Brand & Trust**
- Reputation that takes years to build
- Example: Stripe for payment processing

**6. Cost Structure**
- Economies of scale or unique efficiency
- Example: Amazon's logistics network

#### Example: Netflix Recommendations
**Hard to Copy:** Requires massive viewing data + years of algorithm development + content tagging by humans. Competitors starting today would be years behind.

#### For Product Strategy
Ask yourself:
- What prevents competitors from copying this in 6 months?
- What unique advantages do we have?
- Are we building a moat or just features?
- What gets stronger over time?

#### Red Flags
❌ "We'll move fast and get there first" (first-mover rarely wins)
❌ "It'll be hard to build" (if you can build it, so can they)
❌ No durable advantage, just execution
❌ Relying solely on patents or secrecy

### M = MARGIN-ENHANCING

**Question:** Does this improve our business model and unit economics?

#### What It Means
- Increases revenue per customer
- Reduces costs
- Improves retention (increases LTV)
- Enables better monetization
- Creates pricing power
- Improves efficiency

#### Ways to Enhance Margin

**1. Increase Revenue**
- Higher prices customers will pay
- Upsell/cross-sell opportunities
- New revenue streams
- Better monetization

**2. Reduce Costs**
- Automation
- Operational efficiency
- Lower customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Reduced support costs

**3. Improve Retention**
- Higher customer lifetime value (LTV)
- Reduced churn
- Stronger switching costs
- Habit formation

**4. Enable Premium Positioning**
- Justify higher prices
- Attract higher-value customers
- Reduce price sensitivity

#### Example: Netflix Recommendations
**Margin-Enhancing:** Increases content utilization (users find value in more of the catalog), improves retention (users don't churn because they always find something), reduces marketing cost (discovery is built-in vs. promoting specific titles).

#### For Product Strategy
Ask yourself:
- Does this increase LTV or reduce CAC?
- Will this improve retention?
- Can we charge more because of this?
- Does this make operations more efficient?
- What's the ROI on building this?

#### Red Flags
❌ "It'll increase engagement" (but no path to monetization)
❌ "Everyone has this feature" (table stakes, no margin benefit)
❌ Expensive to build and maintain, unclear revenue impact
❌ Might delight users but hurts unit economics

## How to Use DHM

### Step 1: Score Your Strategy on Each Dimension

Rate each dimension honestly:
- **High** - Strong performance on this dimension
- **Medium** - Moderate performance
- **Low** - Weak performance

### Step 2: Identify Gaps

Where is your strategy weakest? That's where you need to focus.

| Strategy | Delight | Hard to Copy | Margin-Enhancing | Assessment |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| A | High | Low | Medium | Vulnerable - easy to copy |
| B | High | High | Low | Unsustainable - burns cash |
| C | Low | High | High | No PMF - customers don't care |
| **Ideal** | **High** | **High** | **High** | **Strong strategy** |

### Step 3: Improve Your Strategy

For each low-scoring dimension, ask:
- **Low Delight?** Do we really understand the customer problem? Is our solution 10x better?
- **Low Hard to Copy?** What moat can we build? What gets stronger over time?
- **Low Margin-Enhancing?** How does this improve unit economics? What's the business model?

### Step 4: Pressure-Test with Competitors

How would your competitors score on DHM for their strategy? Where are they weak? That's your opportunity.

## Examples: DHM in Practice

### Example 1: Spotify Discover Weekly

**D - Delight:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Solves "what should I listen to?" problem
- Personalized to your taste
- Introduces you to new artists
- Users love it (high engagement, social sharing)

**H - Hard to Copy:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Requires listening data + collaborative filtering
- Gets better with scale
- Competitors can copy the concept, but data moat takes time to build

**M - Margin-Enhancing:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Increases time spent in app (retention)
- Reduces reliance on expensive promoted playlists
- Helps surface catalog (increases content utilization)
- Improves LTV

**Assessment:** Strong strategy across all dimensions

---

### Example 2: Social Media "Stories" Feature

**D - Delight:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Fun, ephemeral sharing
- Lower pressure than permanent posts
- Visual and engaging

**H - Hard to Copy:** ⭐
- Snapchat invented it, then everyone copied
- No durable moat
- Network effects are at platform level, not feature level

**M - Margin-Enhancing:** ⭐⭐⭐
- Increases engagement (retention)
- New ad inventory
- But expensive to build and maintain

**Assessment:** Delights users but easy to copy. Only worthwhile for platforms with strong network effects. Dangerous for smaller players.

---

### Example 3: Productivity App with AI Voice Assistant

Let's say TaskFlow (our fictional company) is considering an AI voice assistant for managing to-dos.

**D - Delight:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium-High)
- Convenient hands-free task management
- Faster than typing
- Novel experience
- BUT: Is it 10x better than existing methods? Or just cool?

**H - Hard to Copy:** ⭐⭐ (Low-Medium)
- Voice recognition is commodity (OpenAI, Google)
- Natural language understanding is becoming commodity
- Competitors can build this in months
- NO durable moat here

**M - Margin-Enhancing:** ⭐⭐ (Low-Medium)
- Might improve engagement slightly
- Increases infrastructure costs (voice processing, AI costs)
- Could justify premium pricing?
- Unclear ROI

**Assessment:** Risky. Might delight early adopters but easy to copy and margins are unclear. Need to find a way to make it more defensible (perhaps through deep integration with existing workflow data?) or rethink the approach.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Focusing Only on Delight
Building features customers love but that don't improve your business model or create defensibility. Classic startup trap.

### Mistake 2: Pursuing "Hard to Copy" Without Delight
Building technical moats that customers don't care about. Engineers love this; customers don't.

### Mistake 3: Margin-Enhancing at the Expense of Delight
Optimizing for revenue extraction at the cost of customer experience. Short-term gains, long-term churn.

### Mistake 4: Copying Competitors
Just because a competitor has a feature doesn't mean it scores well on DHM for YOUR business. Context matters.

### Mistake 5: Overestimating Defensibility
Thinking "we'll move fast" or "it's complex to build" makes something hard to copy. It doesn't. Real moats are durable.

## DHM + Other Frameworks

### DHM + Rumelt's Kernel
- **Diagnosis** should reveal where you can win on DHM
- **Guiding Policy** should state which dimension(s) you're optimizing for
- **Coherent Actions** should strengthen multiple DHM dimensions

### DHM + SWOT
- **Strengths** = Existing advantages in H (Hard to Copy)
- **Opportunities** = Where you can improve D, H, or M
- **Weaknesses** = Low scores on DHM dimensions
- **Threats** = Competitors with better DHM scores

## Quick Reference Checklist

When evaluating a strategic direction, ask:

**DELIGHT**
- [ ] Does this solve a real, painful problem?
- [ ] Is our solution 10x better than alternatives?
- [ ] Do we have evidence customers will love this?
- [ ] Would customers be upset if we removed it?

**HARD TO COPY**
- [ ] What prevents competitors from copying this quickly?
- [ ] Do we have a durable advantage (network effects, data, brand, etc.)?
- [ ] What gets stronger over time?
- [ ] Is our moat real or wishful thinking?

**MARGIN-ENHANCING**
- [ ] Does this increase revenue or reduce costs?
- [ ] Will this improve retention/LTV?
- [ ] What's the ROI on building this?
- [ ] Does this improve our unit economics?

**If you can't check most boxes, rethink your strategy.**

## Remember

**A strong product strategy scores high on ALL THREE dimensions.**

Delight alone isn't enough. You need defensibility and sound economics.

Use DHM to:
1. Evaluate strategic options
2. Identify weaknesses in your strategy
3. Pressure-test against competitors
4. Prioritize what to build

**DHM forces you to think beyond features and consider sustainable competitive advantage.**
