# Module 2.3: Develop Product Strategy - Ultra Simple Outline

## Files Needed to Start

- `taskflow-company-context.md` (company background, used throughout course)
- `user-research/activation-feedback.md` (activation success from Module 2.2)
- `frameworks/rumelt-strategy-kernel.md` (Diagnosis → Guiding Policy → Coherent Actions framework - the main framework used)
- `frameworks/swot-analysis.md` (additional resource mentioned at end)
- `frameworks/gibson-biddle-dhm.md` (additional resource mentioned at end)
- `methods/devils-advocate-strategy.md` (method for challenging strategic choices)

## Files Created During Module

- `h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md` (complete AI strategy based on user's 5 strategic choices - includes diagnosis, guiding policy, coherent actions/roadmap, assumptions, competitive positioning)
- `strategy-review-slides.pptx` (PowerPoint slide deck created via pptx skill)

## High-Level Overview

- Scenario: You're the Gen AI PM at TaskFlow. You shipped AI voice chat for todos (Module 2.1 PRD) and improved activation with guided onboarding (Module 2.2). Leadership asks "How should we evolve our AI strategy for H1 2026?" You need to develop a strategic direction for AI-powered features
- This module teaches how to develop product strategy using AI as a thinking partner - not to generate strategy for you, but to help you think more rigorously about strategic choices
- Product strategy is about WHERE to compete and HOW to win - it requires making hard tradeoffs, saying no to things, and focusing resources on a few coherent bets
- You'll learn to use strategic frameworks Rumelt's Strategy Kernel systematically, pressure-test your thinking with devil's advocate, and build actual slides to strategy clearly for stakeholders
- The key insight: AI can't make strategic decisions for you (only you have the context and judgment), but AI can help you research faster, apply frameworks rigorously, challenge your assumptions, and communicate clearly
- Introduce Rumelt's Strategy Kernel framework from `frameworks/rumelt-strategy-kernel.md` (author of "Good Strategy, Bad Strategy") which has 3 parts: Diagnosis (what's the challenge?), Guiding Policy (our approach), and Coherent Actions (how we execute) - this will structure the entire strategy you build
- Present the strategic situation to user (2-person AI team, moderate activation success, competitive pressure, AI infrastructure costs, SMB focus), explain they'll make strategic choices that shape the strategy
- Ask user to say "Spin up multiple agents to research the competitive AI landscape", Claude uses WebSearch to research how Notion/Linear/Asana approach AI features and summarize findings in the chat
- Present user with 5 multiple choice strategic questions that force real tradeoffs (questions cover: focus vs breadth decision, competitive response approach, business model/pricing choice, product scope decision, risk tolerance/speed vs quality)
- User answers each question (A/B/C choices), each answer shapes a different aspect of the strategy
- Tell users that devil's advocate can is a way AI can help them refine their thinking. Better to get these questions here than from an exec! After each choice, use devil's advocate from `methods/devils-advocate-strategy.md` to challenge the choice ("You chose to focus deeply on voice - but what if voice becomes commoditized?"), user can stick with choice or reconsider - give A or B options
- Based on user's 5 choices, Claude synthesizes a complete strategy in `h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md` using Rumelt's Kernel structure (Diagnosis from research, Guiding Policy from their strategic choices, Coherent Actions as 6-month roadmap aligned with their choices)
- Introduce /skills feature ("Skills extend what Claude Code can do - one can turn your strategy into a slide deck"), ask user "Want me to create executive slides from your strategy?", use /skills to generate `strategy-review-slides.pdf` from the strategy doc
- Wrap up: Show how their 5 choices created a coherent strategy using Rumelt's Kernel, emphasize they made strategic tradeoffs (said yes to some things, no to others), devil's advocate helped stress-test each choice, mention other frameworks they could explore in `frameworks/swot-analysis.md` (for analyzing strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats) and `frameworks/gibson-biddle-dhm.md` (for scoring strategy on Delight/Hard to Copy/Margin-enhancing)
