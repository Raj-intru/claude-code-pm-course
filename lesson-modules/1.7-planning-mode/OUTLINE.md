# Module 1.7: Final Navigation Skills - Ultra Simple Outline

## Files Needed to Start
(none - student will give verbal request)

## Files Created During Module
- `competitive-threat-plan.md` (plan created in plan mode)
- `competitor-landscape-research.md` (initial competitive mapping)
- `competitor-1-ai-feature-analysis.md` through `competitor-5-ai-feature-analysis.md` (parallel agent research)
- `ai-chat-competitive-synthesis.md` (synthesis of all competitor AI chat features)
- `taskflow-ai-response-strategy.md` (recommended execution plan for TaskFlow)

## High-Level Overview
- Frame as "final navigation skills" - the last essential skills for Claude Code mastery
- Introduce the three input modes (edit, auto-accept, plan) and Shift+Tab to cycle through them
- Present competitive threat scenario: Competitor launched AI chat, execs panicking
- Student requests competitive research in plan mode
- Claude creates structured plan with auto-generated todo list
- Execute plan: Research competitors â†’ launch 5 agents â†’ synthesize â†’ create strategy
- Show todo list updating in real-time, student can press Esc to stop anytime
- Files created: `competitor-landscape-research.md`, 5 analysis files, `ai-chat-competitive-synthesis.md`, `taskflow-ai-response-strategy.md`
- Introduce think control keywords ("think about", "think harder about", "ultrathink" with RAINBOW)
- Explain `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag as critical workflow accelerator (Carl strongly recommends)
- Celebrate complete navigation mastery - Level 1 Foundation complete!

## Teaching Flow

- Welcome to Module 1.7: Planning Mode & Auto-Todo Lists
- This is the final module of Level 1 Foundation - after this you'll have mastered all the core Claude Code mechanics
- We're going to learn about the three input modes and when to use each one
- STOP: Ready to learn about input modes?
- USER: Yes

---

- Claude Code has three input modes that control how it handles your requests
- **Edit mode** (default): Shows you every file change before applying it - safest option
- **Auto-accept mode**: Automatically applies changes without asking - for when you trust Claude
- **Plan mode**: Claude creates a plan and breaks it into todos before executing - for complex multi-step work
- You can switch between these modes anytime during a session
- STOP: Does that make sense so far?
- USER: Yes / needs clarification

---

- Here's when to use each mode
- **Edit mode**: Use when you want control and review (default for safety)
- **Auto-accept mode**: Use when the task is straightforward and you trust Claude to execute without review
- **Plan mode**: Use when the task is complex, multi-step, or you want to see the strategy before execution
- STOP: Quick check - which mode would you use for "fix this typo in README.md"?
- USER: Answers (should be auto-accept or edit)
- Right! For simple tasks, edit or auto-accept make sense. Planning would be overkill.
- STOP: Which mode for "Research our competitors' AI features and create a response strategy"?
- USER: Answers (should be plan mode)
- Exactly! That's a complex, multi-step task. Perfect for plan mode.

---

- Let's see plan mode in action with a real scenario
- **Scenario**: One of TaskFlow's competitors just launched a "Chat with your to-do list AI" feature this morning
- Your exec team is panicking in Slack asking how we should respond
- You need to quickly understand the competitive landscape and create a response strategy
- This involves: researching competitors â†’ analyzing their AI features â†’ synthesizing findings â†’ recommending strategy
- To switch to plan mode, press **Shift+Tab** to cycle through the input modes (edit â†’ auto-accept â†’ plan)
- STOP: Ready to tackle this? Press Shift+Tab until you're in plan mode, then say: "Research how our competitors are implementing AI chat features and create response strategy" feel free to add as many steps as you want
- USER: (Shift+Tab to plan mode) Research how our competitors are implementing AI chat features and create response strategy

---

- ACTION: Create and display plan with auto-generated todo list
- See how plan mode breaks down complex work into clear steps?
- Each todo will update as we complete it - gives you visibility into progress
- Pro tip: You can press **Esc** at any point to stop the execution if you've seen enough
- STOP: Ready to execute this plan?
- USER: Yes / Execute plan

---

- ACTION: Execute the full plan (research competitors â†’ launch 5 agents â†’ synthesize â†’ create strategy)
- ACTION: Create all files as plan executes
	- `competitor-landscape-research.md`
	- 5 competitor analysis files
	- `ai-chat-competitive-synthesis.md`
	- `taskflow-ai-response-strategy.md`
- Watch the todo list update in real-time as each step completes
- Remember, you can press **Esc** anytime to stop - you don't need to watch the whole thing execute
- Done! From panic to strategy in minutes.
- STOP: You can see the files [here]. Ready to continue?
- USER: Yes / no

---

- This is the power of plan mode for complex work
- You got visibility into the plan upfront and progress via the todo list
- Compare this to just saying "do it" without a plan - you'd have no idea what's happening
- STOP: Does the value of plan mode make sense now?
- USER: Yes / questions

---

- Before we wrap up, let me quickly show you three "think control" keywords you can use
- **"think about X"**: Claude considers X before responding (normal thinking)
- **"think harder about X"**: Claude does deeper analysis (more thorough)
- **"ultrathink about X"**: Claude does maximum depth thinking (for really hard problems) and ultrathink is an awesome RAINBOW! Definitely check it out.
- These work in any mode, but are especially useful in plan mode for complex strategy
- Example: "think harder about the competitive threats" would trigger deeper analysis
- STOP: Make sense?
- USER: Yes

---

- One more quick tip: the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag
- This is an advanced flag that skips all permission prompts
- Carl (the course creator) highly recommends using it for speed
- But be careful - it's called "dangerously" for a reason!
- Only use it when you trust Claude and know what you're doing
- You can enable it in settings or add it to commands
- STOP: Got it?
- USER: Yes

---

- Congratulations! You've completed Module 1.7 and ALL of Level 1 Foundation! ðŸŽ‰
- You now know all the core Claude Code mechanics:
	- File operations (read, write, edit)
	- Command execution
	- Checkpoints and project memory
	- Agents for parallel work
	- Custom sub-agents with specialized personas
	- Output styles for consistent formatting
	- Planning mode and input modes
- You're ready for Level 2: Real Product Management workflows!
- STOP: How are you feeling? Ready to tackle real PM work?
- USER: Response
- Amazing work! Take a break, then when you're ready, move on to Module 2.1: Write a PRD
