# TaskFlow Company Context

## Company Overview

**TaskFlow** is a fast-growing SaaS productivity platform designed for remote and hybrid teams. Think Asana meets Jira, but built specifically for distributed work.

**Founded:** 2021
**Employees:** 45 people (15 product/eng, 10 sales/marketing, 20 customer success/ops)
**Customers:** 850 companies, ranging from 10-500 employees
**Revenue:** $4.2M ARR, growing 15% month-over-month
**Funding:** Series A ($8M raised from Acme Ventures)

## Product

TaskFlow is a project management and collaboration platform with three core modules:

1. **Task Management** - Create, assign, track tasks with dependencies, priorities, and deadlines
2. **Team Collaboration** - Real-time comments, file sharing, @mentions, activity feeds
3. **Workflow Automation** - Custom workflows, automated status updates, integrations with Slack/email

**Key differentiator:** Built for remote teams from day one - async-first communication, timezone awareness, flexible notification settings, and detailed activity logs so people can catch up anytime.

## Target Customers

**Primary:** Mid-size tech companies (50-200 employees) with distributed teams

**Personas:**
- **Product Managers** - Need to coordinate cross-functional teams, track feature development, manage roadmaps
- **Engineering Managers** - Need sprint planning, task tracking, burndown charts
- **Marketing Teams** - Need campaign planning, content calendars, approval workflows

## Market Position

**Competitors:**
- **Asana** - More features but complex UI, not async-friendly
- **Linear** - Great for eng teams but not cross-functional
- **Notion** - Flexible but requires too much setup
- **Monday.com** - Good automation but expensive

**TaskFlow's edge:** Simple enough to onboard in 10 minutes, powerful enough for complex projects, built for async remote work.

## Current Priorities

**Q1 2025 Goals:**
1. Reach $6M ARR (40% growth)
2. Launch AI-powered features to stay competitive
3. Improve enterprise readiness (SSO, advanced permissions)
4. Reduce churn from 3% to 2% monthly

**Strategic Initiatives:**
- **AI Integration** - Competitors are adding AI fast. Needs to differentiate or risk losing deals.
- **Mobile App** - Top feature request. 60% of users want to manage tasks on mobile.
- **Advanced Analytics** - Enterprise customers want custom reports and dashboards.

## Team & Culture

**Leadership:**
- **Sarah Chen** - CEO (ex-Atlassian PM)
- **Marcus Johnson** - CTO (ex-Google engineer)
- **Priya Patel** - Head of Product (that's your boss!)

**Product Team:**
- 3 Product Managers (you're one of them)
- 8 Engineers (split into 2 squads: Core Platform + Growth)
- 2 Designers
- 1 User Researcher

**Culture:**
- Remote-first, fully distributed
- Ship small, ship often (2-week sprints)
- Data-informed but not data-driven (qualitative + quantitative)
- Customer-centric (PMs spend 3 hours/week talking to customers)

## Why This Matters

You're working at a **critical inflection point**:
- Growing fast but competition is fierce
- Need to innovate without breaking what works
- Every feature needs to drive retention or expansion
- Can't afford to build the wrong thing

Your PRDs need to balance:
✅ Customer needs (what they're asking for)
✅ Business goals (what drives revenue/retention)
✅ Technical feasibility (what we can actually build)
✅ Strategic positioning (what keeps us competitive)

---

**Remember:** You're not building features in a vacuum. Every decision affects growth, retention, and competitive position. Your PRDs need to tell the story of why THIS feature, why NOW, and why it matters to TaskFlow's success.
